### CATEGORY DETAILS (Expandable breakdown per category)

---

#### 1. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT / R&D — ₹50 Lakhs (50%)

> **Purpose:** Build and validate 10 production-ready tooling tools on the RapidTools platform. Every rupee here directly creates the product that customers pay for.

| Sub-Item | Amount | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud compute infrastructure (AWS/GCP) | ₹12L | Geometry processing engine requires GPU-class compute; 12-month AWS credits + reserved instances. 100+ fixture designs/month at scale |
| CAD kernel commercial licence (Open CASCADE / Parasolid) | ₹8L | Manufacturing-grade geometric modelling requires certified kernel — cannot use open source for IATF 16949 validated output |
| 3D printer hardware for development lab | ₹10L | Fracktal Works FDM + resin unit for in-house fixture validation and customer demo prints. Physical validation of every tool output |
| Metrology / scanning equipment | ₹5L | Coordinate measuring machine (CMM) rental + 3D scanner for dimensional accuracy validation of printed fixtures (ASME Y14.5 compliance) |
| Software development tools & licences | ₹5L | SolidWorks API licence (for output validation), GitHub Enterprise, JetBrains suite, Figma, CI/CD toolchain |
| IP filing & patent prosecution | ₹5L | 2 provisional patents: (1) intent-to-GD&T algorithm, (2) casting mould topology optimisation. Filed via registered patent attorney |
| Testing materials (filament, resin, consumables) | ₹5L | 100+ physical fixture prototype prints for QA validation across all 10 tooling categories |
| **Sub-total** | **₹50L** | |

---

#### 2. SALARIES — ₹20 Lakhs (20%)

> **Purpose:** Remuneration for two technical hires working directly on product development. Founders are separately funded from Seed round — grant salary funds non-founder engineers only.

## DESIGNER NOTES

**This slide works as a single compliance table** for grant reviewers — the breakdown table at the top is the primary element.

**Recommended layout:**
- Top: Bold headline + total ask (₹100L) in large type
- Centre: 5-row budget table with ₹ amounts, percentages, compliance ticks
- Bottom-left: Milestone disbursement diagram (2 tranches)
- Bottom-right: Grant ROI table

**Colours:** Use green checkmarks () prominently — grant reviewers scan for compliance. 
R&D bar should be visually dominant (50%).

**Key message for Karnataka Elevate judges:** Every rupee is accounted for, milestone-linked, and generates 14 revenue return for Karnataka's manufacturing sector.
