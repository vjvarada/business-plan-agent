## SLIDE 1 OF 2 — "How We Price and What We Charge"

### Headline: **Four Income Streams. One Simple Hook: ₹20,000/year for Unlimited Fixtures.**

---

### PRICING STRATEGY — VALUE-BASED, NOT COST-PLUS

**The reference price anchor:**

> Today, a manufacturer pays ₹40,000–₹65,000 to outsource ONE fixture design, and waits 4 weeks.
> RapidTools charges ₹2,00,000/year ($2,400) for UNLIMITED fixtures, delivered in 2 hours.
> At just 2 fixtures per month, the customer covers the annual licence cost entirely.
> At 12 fixtures per year, the saving is ₹2.8–4.6 lakh. The ROI argument writes itself.

**Pricing philosophy:** Value-based. We price at ~5% of the annual cost we replace, making the "yes" decision trivial at every level of organisation.

### REVENUE STREAM 1 — SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION (SaaS)

**The core, recurring, high-margin engine.**

| Plan             | Price (INR)       | Price (USD) | Who It's For              | Includes                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Starter**      | ₹2,00,000/year    | $2,400/yr   | MSME / job shop (1 seat)  | Fixtures + Vacuum Casting; unlimited designs     |
| **Professional** | ₹5,00,000/year    | $6,000/yr   | Tier-2 supplier (3 seats) | All 10 tools; priority support; STEP/STL export  |
| **Enterprise**   | ₹8,00,000/year    | $9,600/yr   | OEM plant (5 seats)       | All tools; IATF 16949 docs; dedicated onboarding |
| **Enterprise+**  | Custom (₹12L+/yr) | $15K+/yr    | Multi-plant OEMs          | Multi-site; ERP integration; SLA-backed support  |

**Gross Margin: 80%**
**Annual billing only (reduces churn, improves cash flow)**

---

### REVENUE STREAM 2 — DESIGN SERVICES (Job Work)

**For customers who don't want to design themselves — they just want the fixture.**

| Service                         | Price                      | Turnaround  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Fixture Design + Print**      | ₹8,000–₹25,000 per fixture | 24–48 hours |
| **Vacuum Mould Design + Print** | ₹15,000–₹50,000 per mould  | 48–72 hours |
| **Fixture Audit & Redesign**    | ₹5,000–₹12,000 per fixture | 24 hours    |
| **Managed Tooling Programme**   | ₹50,000–₹2,00,000/month    | Ongoing     |

> This stream converts SMBs who want results without learning software.
> It creates stickiness: once a customer trusts our design quality, they rarely switch.

**Gross Margin: 25%** (software automation reduces design time 80%, improving margins over time)

---

### REVENUE STREAM 3 — HARDWARE SALES

**We sell Fracktal Works 3D printers as the preferred hardware for RapidTools output.**

| Product                          | Price Range | Buyer                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Fracktal Julia Pro (desktop FDM) | ₹1.5L–₹3L   | MSME / job shop         |
| Fracktal Workbench Series        | ₹5L–₹15L    | Mid-market manufacturer |
| Fracktal Industrial Series       | ₹15L–₹25L   | OEM / Defence           |

> Honda purchased a Fracktal printer for ₹10 lakh alongside our software deployment.
> Hardware is not our core business — but every printer we sell increases software stickiness and consumables revenue.

**Gross Margin: 24%** (reseller model; preferred vendor pricing from Fracktal)

---

### REVENUE STREAM 4 — CONSUMABLES

**Recurring materials revenue from customers running our printers.**

| Material                        | Price                | Consumption                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| PLA / PETG engineering filament | ₹3,000–₹5,000/kg     | ~2 kg/week at active customer |
| Nylon / Carbon-fill filament    | ₹8,000–₹15,000/kg    | Heavy-duty tooling            |
| Resin (for SLA/precision parts) | ₹6,000–₹12,000/litre | Casting masters               |

**Annual consumables spend per hardware customer: ₹80,000–₹3,00,000/year**
**Gross Margin: 33%**

**Key milestones:**

- Year 1: Honda (₹8L ARR alone) + XDM paid → 8 customers, product validated at enterprise grade
- Year 2: VAR channel activated → 50 customers, near break-even as software mix improves
- Year 3: Profitable ✅ → 120 customers, services attach at scale, SE Asia expansion begins

**Growth driver:** VAR channel activates fully in Year 2 — 6 resellers with 5,500 warm manufacturing contacts means 50 customers is just 1% conversion. Y2 growth is 5.8× (channel flywheel), then normalises to 2.9× in Y3 as we expand to SE Asia.

### PRICING LOGIC — WHY CUSTOMERS SAY YES FAST

```
CUSTOMER'S CURRENT ANNUAL TOOLING COST (Mid-market, 50 fixtures/yr):
  Outsourced design:    50  ₹40,000 = ₹20,00,000/yr
  + Lost productivity:  2–4 weeks wait  50 = 100+ engineer-weeks
  + Rework/rejects:     ~10% rework rate = ₹2,00,000 extra

  TOTAL COST TODAY:     ₹22,00,000/year

SAME CUSTOMER WITH RAPIDTOOLS:
  Software licence:            ₹5,00,000/yr (Pro plan, 3 seats @ $2,400/seat)
  Services (10 complex tools): ₹5,00,000/yr
  Fracktal printer (amort.):   ₹1,00,000/yr

  TOTAL COST WITH RAPIDTOOLS:  ₹11,00,000/year

  SAVING:    ₹11,00,000/year (50% cost reduction)
  ROI:       3 months payback
```

### CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE & ACQUISITION COST

**Three customer tiers — realistic India-market assumptions:**

|                                | SMB / MSME                | Mid-Market Supplier      | Enterprise OEM             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Example customer**           | Local job shop            | Tier-2 auto supplier     | Honda / TVS plant          |
| **Annual revenue (ARPU)**      | ₹2,00,000 ($2,400)        | ₹5,00,000 ($6,000)       | ₹8,00,000 ($9,600)         |
| **Annual churn rate**          | 20%                       | 12%                      | 7%                         |
| **Average customer lifetime**  | 5 years                   | 8 years                  | 14 years                   |
| **Gross margin**               | 60%                       | 55%                      | 50%                        |
| **LTV** (ARPU × Lifetime × GM) | **₹6L**                   | **₹22L**                 | **₹56L**                   |
|                                |                           |                          |                            |
| **CAC**                        | ₹30,000                   | ₹1,20,000                | ₹6,00,000                  |
| **How acquired**               | VAR referral / warm intro | VAR demo + 1-month pilot | CEO direct + 3-month pilot |
| **LTV:CAC ratio**              | **20:1**                  | **18:1**                 | **9:1**                    |
| **CAC Payback Period**         | 1.8 months                | 2.9 months               | 9 months                   |

**Healthy benchmark: LTV:CAC > 3:1**
**Our range: 6:1 – 12:1 — strong, but achievable given:**

- CAC is low because 6 VARs bring warm intros (no cold outbound for most customers)
- Lifetime is long because manufacturing customers don't switch tools mid-production
- India cost structure: sales/support at 1/3rd the cost of US equivalents

**Note on LTV:CAC ratios:** The high ratios (9–20:1) reflect India-market CAC (warm VAR intros + low-cost sales team) against strong ARPU ($2,400+ base). As we expand to US/Europe, CAC will rise 2–3× and ratios will normalise toward 5–8:1 — still well above the 3:1 healthy SaaS threshold.

**Why churn is manageable:**

- SMB 20% churn: typical for early-stage B2B SaaS India; reduces to 12% as product matures
- Mid-market 12%: accounts for budget cuts; offset by seat-expansion revenue
- Enterprise 7%: multi-plant OEMs rarely switch once IATF 16949 certification is integrated

| **Average contract length**        | 12 months | 12 months | 12–24 months |

> **NRR > 100% by Year 3** means existing customers are expanding faster than churning —
> the business grows even with zero new customer acquisition.
