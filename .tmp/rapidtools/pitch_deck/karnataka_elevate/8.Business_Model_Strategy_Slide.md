**The buyer is the Manufacturing Operations team — not IT, not R&D.**
Their pain: CAD team backlogged. Tooling outsourcing: ₹40K/fixture, 4-week wait. No self-service option.
Their job title: Production Manager, Tooling Lead, Manufacturing Engineer.

### VALUE PROPOSITION (Centre — the core "so what")

> **For any manufacturer who designs or outsources tooling (jigs, fixtures, casting moulds): RapidTools replaces a 4-week, ₹40,000 outsourced design with a 2-hour, ₹1,600-equivalent self-service — with no CAD training required.**

|                                       | Today (Without RapidTools)                 | With RapidTools                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Who designs**                       | Outsourced CAD agency or internal CAD team | Any production engineer — no CAD needed         |
| **Time to fixture design**            | 2–4 weeks                                  | **2 hours**                                     |
| **Cost per fixture**                  | ₹40,000–₹65,000 outsourced                 | **₹1,600 effective** (₹2L/yr unlimited)         |
| **Output quality**                    | Varies; certification manual               | ASME Y14.5 GD&T validated; print-ready STEP/STL |
| **Can replace broken fixture today?** | No — wait 4 weeks                          | **Yes — same day**                              |

**Unique value RapidTools provides that no one else does in India:**

- Intent-driven UX — no CAD skills needed
- Manufacturing-certified output — not visual 3D generation
- India pricing — 4× cheaper than Trinckle (Europe's equivalent at $9,600/yr) for same capability
- Casting tools — vacuum casting and sand casting not available in any competitor product

### REVENUE MODEL — FOUR STREAMS

| Plan                           | What It Is                                        | Price (INR)                              | Price (USD)      | Gross Margin | Year 3 Mix |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Software SaaS**              | Annual seat licence for tooling design automation | ₹2L/yr (SMB, 1 seat) to ₹8L/yr (5 seats) | $2,400–$9,600/yr | 80%          | 64%        |
| **Design Services** (job work) | We design + print the tool for the customer       | ₹8K–₹50K per project                     | $100–$600        | 25%          | 25%        |
| **Hardware**                   | Fracktal Works 3D printers (preferred vendor)     | ₹5L–₹25L per machine                     | $6K–$30K         | 24%          | 8%         |
| **Consumables**                | 3D printing filament / resin (recurring)          | ₹3K–₹15K/kg                              | $36–$180/kg      | 33%          | 3%         |

**Land and Expand Logic:**

```
LAND with Software (₹2L/yr)
   EXPAND to Services (customer outsources design to us: ₹30K/project)
   EXPAND to Hardware (customer buys printer to do it in-house: ₹10L one-time)
   LOCK IN with Consumables (recurring materials: ₹5K/month)
```

Each step raises switching cost. Customers using 3+ streams have 4 lower churn.

### SALES & DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS (Left column)

**Channel 1 — Direct Sales (15% of revenue)**

- CEO Vijay personally leads enterprise sales: Honda, TVS, Toyota, Toyoda Gosei
- Purpose: Generate flagship case studies that arms channel partners
- "Honda HMSI Kolar" as logo cuts VAR sales cycle from 3 months to 1 month

**Channel 2 — VAR Network (65% of revenue) — THE PRIMARY ENGINE**
Like Autodesk and SolidWorks, RapidTools uses Value-Added Resellers to reach SMBs and mid-market.
