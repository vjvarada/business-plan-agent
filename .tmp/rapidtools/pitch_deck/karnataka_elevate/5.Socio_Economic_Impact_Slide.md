### ECONOMIC IMPACT — KARNATAKA FIRST (Left panel)

**Direct Jobs Created in Karnataka**

| Phase | Headcount | Location | Role Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seed (FY2027) | 15 | Bengaluru | Engineers, sales, operations |
| Series A (FY2028) | 40 | Bengaluru + Kolar | Product, support, services |
| Year 3 (FY2029) | 80+ | Bengaluru + satellite | Full team + field services |

> Karnataka HQ. Karnataka engineering team. Karnataka customers first.

**Indirect Economic Impact (200 customers by Year 3)**

- Each customer **upskills 3–5 shop-floor workers** into digital design roles
   **600–1,000 workers** gain income-enhancing digital skills by Year 3
- Each MSME customer **saves ₹8–12L/year** in outsourced tooling costs
   ₹16–24 crore reinvested into Karnataka/TN manufacturing by Year 3
- **Import substitution:** India imports ~₹600 crore of precision tooling tools from Germany and Japan annually
  *(Source: DGFT Export-Import Data Bank, 2024)*
  RapidTools enables in-house design replacing imported tooling dependency

**MSME Democratisation (The Core Social Argument)**

> Today, only large OEMs (Honda, TVS, Toyota) can afford professional tooling design.
> An MSME job shop pays ₹40,000–65,000 per fixture and waits 4 weeks.
> RapidTools changes the unit economics:

| | Large OEM | MSME Today | MSME with RapidTools |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost per fixture | ₹40K (outsourced) | ₹40K–65K | **₹1,600 effective** (₹20K/yr  12) |
| Lead time | 4 weeks | 4–6 weeks | **2 hours** |
| In-house capability | Partial | None | **Full** |

**Alignment with Karnataka MSME Policy:**
Karnataka has India's 2nd-largest MSME base — 3.4M+ units, 30L+ workers.

## SLIDE 2 OF 2 — "The Environmental & SDG Impact"
### Headline: **Greener Manufacturing. Global Goals. Local Action.**

### ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT (Left panel — 2 visual comparisons)

**1. Additive vs Subtractive: A Material Revolution**

```
TRADITIONAL CNC TOOLING (Subtractive)        3D PRINTED TOOLING (Additive)
         
Aluminium block: 3–5 kg input          vs.   PLA/Nylon: 300–500g input
Finished fixture: 500–800g output             Finished fixture: 300–500g output
Waste as metal swarf: 75–85%                  Waste as support material: 8–15%

RESULT: 3D printing uses 80–90% less          Source: RWTH Aachen University,
material per fixture, zero cutting fluid      Additive Manufacturing vs CNC
                                              Fixtures, Systematic Review 2024
```

**2. Local Production = Lower Carbon Footprint**

- Tooling currently imported from Germany, Japan, Taiwan
   Each imported fixture: **estimated 800–1,200 km sea + air freight**
- RapidTools enables on-site printing in the OEM's own facility
   **Zero shipping. Zero import carbon. Same-day production.**

**3. Longer Equipment Life = Less Waste**
- Robots idle due to broken/missing fixtures are often replaced entirely
- RapidTools enables same-day replacement design  **extends asset life by 3–5 years**
- Reduces premature equipment scrapping in India's automotive sector

  No cutting fluids.           — no degree required    
  No import shipping.

### THE QUALITY OF LIFE ARGUMENT (Bottom — 2 short paragraphs)

**For the shop-floor worker:**
> A production technician at Honda Kolar earns ₹25,000–40,000/month doing assembly work.
> With RapidTools, that same technician can design the fixtures their team needs.
> This is a **₹12,000–₹20,000/month income upgrade** pathway — the difference between
> "assembly operator" and "manufacturing technologist" on a résumé.

**For India's manufacturing competitiveness:**
> India imports tooling expertise because we lack sufficient domestic design capacity.
> RapidTools **keeps that value chain in India** — design fees, job-work, and hardware revenue
> that currently flows to Germany, Japan, and Taiwan instead stays in Karnataka.
