### WHAT MAKES RAPIDTOOLS UNIQUE (2x2 uniqueness grid)

```

  1. INTENT-DRIVEN UX                 2. COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY CORE    
                                                                        
  No CAD skills needed.               B-spline NURBS + Mesh Boolean     
  A production technician answers     algorithms — the same class of    
  guided questions in plain Indian    mathematics used in aerospace     
  English. RapidTools converts        CAD. 0.1mm tolerance output.     
  those answers into 3D geometry.     ASME Y14.5 GD&T validated.        
                                                                        
  "What does your part look like?"    Not AI hallucination —            
  "Where do you need to clamp?"       deterministic geometry.           
  "What surface must not be marked?"                                    


  3. MULTI-AI ARCHITECTURE            4. MANUFACTURING-CERTIFIED OUTPUT 
                                                                        
  Different tools need different      Doesn't just generate a 3D        
  AI mixes:                           model. Validates it:              
                                                                        
  Fixtures  40% CAD Kernels           Can it be 3D printed?          
             40% UX                      (DfAM rules, overhang check)   
             20% LLM                   Does it fit the part?          
                                         (tolerance 0.1mm)             
  Vacuum Casting  50% CAD Kernels     Does it meet quality std?      
                   30% GenAI             (IATF 16949 for automotive)    
                   20% UX              Print-ready STEP/STL file

### THE FOUNDER'S CREDENTIAL (Why we could build this)

> **Vijay Raghav Varada** — CEO, Applied Additive
> Built the production slicer for Fracktal Works 3D printers (the firmware running on Honda's shop floor today) — mesh toolpath algorithms, G-code optimisation, print parameter tuning.
>
> **"I've been writing manufacturing geometry code for 10 years. RapidTools isn't a startup idea — it's productising algorithms I've already proven work."**

| Built | Technology |
|---|---|
| Fracktal Works 3D-printer slicer | Mesh algorithms, toolpath generation, G-code optimisation |
| Fixture Automation demo | B-spline Boolean ops, GD&T validation — Working today |
| Vacuum Casting Tool demo | Surface continuity, mold parting algorithms — Working today |
| Antarctica 3D-printed wind turbine | Structural geometry + field deployment (Robert Swan polar expedition) |
