## SLIDE 1 OF 2 — "The Crisis"

### Headline: **India's Factories Are Ready. Their Tooling Isn't.**

---

### OPENING — DATA-DRIVEN HOOK (Left Panel — factory floor visual)

**The Bottleneck No One Talks About**

Every robot, assembly line, and production process runs on **tooling** — fixtures, jigs, and molds that hold and position parts. They are so critical that **jigs and fixtures account for up to 29% of total capital investment** in automotive body shops.
_(Source: RWTH Aachen University, Systematic Literature Review on Jigs & Fixtures in Production, 2024)_

Yet today, getting a single fixture designed takes:

| What                   | Hard Reality                                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vendor lead time**   | 4–6 weeks per fixture _(Additive Manufacturing Training, 2024)_ |
| **Cost per fixture**   | ₹20,000–₹65,000 outsourced                                      |
| **Who can design one** | Only a trained CAD specialist — and there aren't enough         |

Meanwhile, **₹1.97 lakh crore in PLI investment** is creating 10,000+ new production lines in India by 2030 — each needing 50–500 custom fixtures.

**The math doesn't work. The bottleneck is design capacity.**

### CONTEXT BOX (Bottom of Slide — 1 sentence explainer)

> **What is Tooling?** Fixtures, jigs, and molds — the custom clamps and holders that every robot,
> assembly line, and production process depends on. Every robot needs 5–15 custom fixtures.
> **Without them, nothing runs.**

### SUPPORTING QUOTE (Sidebar — Bold pull-quote)

> _"In the United States, you could have a meeting of tooling engineers,
> and I'm not sure we could fill the room.
> In China, you could fill multiple football fields."_

> — **Tim Cook, CEO, Apple** _(Bloomberg, 2017; Fortune, 2023)_

### THE GAP IN ONE LINE (Bold callout — centre bottom)

> **Gartner: Only 30–40% of industrial 3D printers are used at full capacity** — the majority are restricted to prototyping. The #1 barrier is not hardware cost or material cost. It is the **design expertise gap.**
>
> _Source: Gartner Hype Cycle for 3D Printing 2023 (Gartner Inc.)_

> **Head-to-head proof it works:** Audi Sport cut fixture design time by **90%** and costs by **80%** using automated tooling software on their shop floor — with zero CAD expertise required from operators.
