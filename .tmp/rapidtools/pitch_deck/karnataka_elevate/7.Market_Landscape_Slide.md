### WHY NO ONE ELSE CAN DO WHAT WE DO (The Moat)

**Three things that must all be true to compete with RapidTools:**

1. **Computational geometry expertise** — B-spline + mesh Boolean algorithms that produce 0.1mm manufacturing-grade output (NOT visual 3D generation)
2. **India manufacturing domain knowledge** — IATF 16949, BIS standards, Hindi-language UX, MSME price points, Fracktal hardware ecosystem
3. **Existing OEM relationships** — Honda, TVS, Toyota, Toyoda Gosei, Bosch (15 years of Fracktal Works trust, not coldcallable)

**No competitor has all three. Trinckle has #1 but not #2 or #3. AI tools have none.**
