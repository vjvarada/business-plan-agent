# Executive Summary - RapidTools

## The $200,000 Robot Waiting for a $500 Jig

Picture a factory floor in Pune. A brand-new robotic arm—$200,000 of precision engineering—sits idle. It's been sitting there for six weeks. The robot works perfectly. The problem? No one can design the fixture that holds the part while the robot works on it.

The production supervisor knows exactly what he needs: *"Clamp the housing here, leave access for the drill at 45 degrees, flip mechanism on this axis."* He could sketch it in five minutes.

But turning that sketch into a manufacturable design? That requires a CAD engineer. The company's tooling design firm has a 3-month backlog. The supervisor's options: wait, or pay $8,000 for a rush job that still takes two weeks.

**This scene is playing out in 50,000 factories across India right now.** And it's about to get much worse.

---

## The Wave Coming

**$2.14 trillion** is being invested globally to rebuild manufacturing (CHIPS Act, India PLI, EU Green Deal). This money is building:
- Semiconductor fabs that each need **500-1,000 custom fixtures**
- Battery plants with **200+ work-holding jigs per line**
- Robotic work cells requiring **5-15 fixtures per robot**

By 2030, robotics alone will require **16 million new fixtures per year**—up from 2.5 million today. That's a **540% increase** in demand.

**But here's the math problem:** There aren't enough tooling engineers on the planet to design them.

> _"In the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields."_
> — **Tim Cook**, CEO of Apple

In India, 60% of experienced tooling engineers will retire in the next decade. The US has 2.1 million unfilled manufacturing jobs. Training a new CAD engineer takes 6-12 months and costs $150,000/year in salary.

**The manufacturing renaissance is being held hostage by a talent shortage that cannot be solved through hiring.**

---

## The Unlock

**What if the production supervisor could design the fixture himself?**

Not by learning CAD—that takes years. Not by describing it to an AI that hallucinates unmachineable geometry. But by simply answering 5 questions about his operation.

This is what RapidTools does.

**We convert operational intent into manufacturing-ready tooling.** The supervisor knows *what* needs to happen. We handle *how* to design it.

| Before RapidTools | After RapidTools |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 2-4 weeks design time | 2 hours |
| $2,000-$8,000 per fixture | $50/month subscription |
| Requires CAD expertise | Requires only process knowledge |
| 3D printer sits idle | Intent → Printed part in one click |

**The insight:** There are **1.2 million production engineers** in India who know exactly what tooling they need—they just can't express it in CAD. We've built the translation layer.

---

## The Company

**RapidTools is the Canva for manufacturing tooling**—we encode decades of hard-won tooling expertise into software that anyone can use.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Addressable Market** | $42 Billion (2025) |
| **Serviceable Addressable Market** | $2.88B → $5.76B (phased expansion) |
| **Year 8 Revenue Target** | $104 Million |
| **Gross Margin** | 65% |
| **EBITDA Margin (Y8)** | 24% |

**How it works:**
1. Upload your part (CAD file, photo, or describe it)
2. Answer 5 simple questions about your operation
3. Get a validated, 3D-printable fixture—ready for production

**What makes us different:**
- **Multi-modal input:** CAD upload + natural language + intuitive UX—the platform adapts to how the engineer thinks
- **Manufacturing validation built-in:** GD&T compliance, DfAM rules, tolerance analysis—100% deterministic, zero hallucinations
- **Hardware integration:** Bundled Fracktal 3D printers—one-click from intent to printed part

## Why Now? — The Perfect Storm

Four forces are converging simultaneously—this window won't last forever:

| Force | Scale | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Government Investment** | $2.14T (CHIPS, PLI, EU Green Deal) | 76% of TAM created by policy since 2022 |
| **Robotics Explosion** | 550K → 2M robots/year by 2030 | 540% growth in fixture demand |
| **Talent Crisis** | 2.1M unfilled US jobs, 60% India retirements | Cannot be solved by hiring |
| **Stranded 3D Printers** | 78% have printers, use for prototypes only | $50K-$200K machines waiting for software |

**Timing:** Companies that solve this in the next 3 years will own the market. The manufacturing buildout is happening now—those factories will lock in their tooling workflows for the next 20 years.

## The Product

**RapidTools is a multi-modal AI platform** that combines four technologies—Intuitive UX, LLMs, Generative AI, and Computational Geometry (CAD Kernels)—in different proportions depending on the tooling type:

### 10 Design Automation Tools (All Production-Ready by End of Y1)

| Tool Type | Status | Primary Technology Mix |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| **Jigs & Fixtures** | ✅ Production | UX (40%) + CAD Kernels (40%) + LLM (20%) |
| **Vacuum Casting Molds** | ✅ Production | CAD Kernels (50%) + Gen AI (30%) + UX (20%) |
| Drilling Guides | 🔄 Y1 | CAD Kernels (60%) + UX (30%) + LLM (10%) |
| Assembly Guides | 🔄 Y1 | UX (50%) + Gen AI (30%) + CAD Kernels (20%) |
| Shadow Boxes | 🔄 Y1 | Gen AI (50%) + UX (30%) + CAD Kernels (20%) |
| Alignment Tools | 🔄 Y1 | CAD Kernels (50%) + UX (40%) + LLM (10%) |
| Custom Palletizing | 🔄 Y1 | LLM (40%) + UX (40%) + CAD Kernels (20%) |
| Sand Casting Tools | 🔄 Y1 | Gen AI (40%) + CAD Kernels (40%) + UX (20%) |
| Soft Jaws | 🔄 Y1 | UX (50%) + CAD Kernels (40%) + LLM (10%) |
| EOAT (End of Arm Tooling) | 🔄 Y1 | LLM (30%) + Gen AI (30%) + CAD Kernels (30%) |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Manufacturing Validation Built-In:** GD&T compliance, DfAM rules, material shrinkage compensation—AI 3D models cannot do this
2. **Intent-to-Design (Not CAD):** Users answer 5 questions, not navigate menus for weeks
3. **Hybrid Architecture:** B-spline precision (±0.1mm tolerances) + mesh speed (seconds, not hours)
4. **Operations Buyer:** Sells to manufacturing operations, not R&D—different buyer, faster cycles
