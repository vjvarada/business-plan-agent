# Executive Summary - RapidTools

> **AI-Powered Tooling Design Automation for Manufacturing**

---

## The Opportunity

**RapidTools transforms how manufacturers design production tooling**—jigs, fixtures, molds, and assembly guides—by encoding 15+ years of tooling expertise into software that anyone can use.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Addressable Market** | $42 Billion (2025) |
| **Serviceable Addressable Market** | $2.88B → $5.76B (phased expansion) |
| **Year 8 Revenue Target** | $104 Million |
| **Gross Margin** | 65% |
| **EBITDA Margin (Y8)** | 24% |

**The Core Problem:** Manufacturing companies worldwide face a critical bottleneck—**tooling design backlogs of 2-4 months** while their $50K-$200K 3D printers sit idle. Traditional CAD software requires 6-12 months of training and $150K/year engineers.

**Our Solution:** RapidTools enables shop floor operators to design manufacturing-ready fixtures in **hours instead of weeks**, with zero CAD expertise required.

---

## Why Now? — Market Timing

Four macro forces are converging to create unprecedented demand for tooling automation:

### 1. Government Manufacturing Investment ($2.14 Trillion, 2022-2030)
- **US:** $420B (CHIPS Act $52B + IRA $369B)
- **India:** ₹3.72 lakh crore (~$45B) in PLI schemes
- **Europe:** €1.54 trillion (Green Deal + EU Chips Act + REPowerEU)
- **Impact:** $32.1B in NEW tooling demand—76% of our TAM created by policy in the last 3 years

### 2. Robotics Explosion (540% Fixture Demand Growth by 2030)
- Robot installations: 550K/year (2023) → 2M+/year (2030)
- Every robot needs 5-20 fixtures for end-of-arm tooling
- **Result:** 16-40M fixtures/year required by 2030

### 3. Manufacturing Talent Crisis
- 2.1M unfilled manufacturing jobs in US by 2030
- 60% of tooling engineers retiring in 10 years (India)
- **Implication:** Software must fill the expertise gap

### 4. 3D Printing Adoption (78% Underutilization)
- 78% of manufacturers have 3D printers but use them only for prototypes
- RapidTools unlocks production applications for stranded capital

---

## The Product

**RapidTools is a multi-modal AI platform** that combines four technologies—Intuitive UX, LLMs, Generative AI, and Computational Geometry (CAD Kernels)—in different proportions depending on the tooling type:

### 10 Design Automation Tools (All Production-Ready by End of Y1)

| Tool Type | Status | Primary Technology Mix |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| **Jigs & Fixtures** | ✅ Production | UX (40%) + CAD Kernels (40%) + LLM (20%) |
| **Vacuum Casting Molds** | ✅ Production | CAD Kernels (50%) + Gen AI (30%) + UX (20%) |
| Drilling Guides | 🔄 Y1 | CAD Kernels (60%) + UX (30%) + LLM (10%) |
| Assembly Guides | 🔄 Y1 | UX (50%) + Gen AI (30%) + CAD Kernels (20%) |
| Shadow Boxes | 🔄 Y1 | Gen AI (50%) + UX (30%) + CAD Kernels (20%) |
| Alignment Tools | 🔄 Y1 | CAD Kernels (50%) + UX (40%) + LLM (10%) |
| Custom Palletizing | 🔄 Y1 | LLM (40%) + UX (40%) + CAD Kernels (20%) |
| Sand Casting Tools | 🔄 Y1 | Gen AI (40%) + CAD Kernels (40%) + UX (20%) |
| Soft Jaws | 🔄 Y1 | UX (50%) + CAD Kernels (40%) + LLM (10%) |
| EOAT (End of Arm Tooling) | 🔄 Y1 | LLM (30%) + Gen AI (30%) + CAD Kernels (30%) |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Manufacturing Validation Built-In:** GD&T compliance, DfAM rules, material shrinkage compensation—AI 3D models cannot do this
2. **Intent-to-Design (Not CAD):** Users answer 5 questions, not navigate menus for weeks
3. **Hybrid Architecture:** B-spline precision (±0.1mm tolerances) + mesh speed (seconds, not hours)
4. **Operations Buyer:** Sells to manufacturing operations, not R&D—different buyer, faster cycles
