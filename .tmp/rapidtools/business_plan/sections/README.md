## Company Structure

| Entity               | What It Is                                                           | TAM           | Status              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Applied Additive** | Platform company—AI-driven intent-to-CAD with computational geometry | $140B+ (2030) | Parent company      |
| **RapidTools**       | First product vertical—manufacturing tooling (fixtures, jigs, EOAT)  | $42B → $65B   | **◄ CURRENT FOCUS** |
| Medical              | Future vertical—dental, implants, surgical guides                    | $15B+         | Planned (Y4-Y6)     |
| Consumer             | Future vertical—jewelry, eyewear, footwear                           | $6B+          | Planned (Y4-Y6)     |
| Architecture         | Future vertical—models, restoration, fixtures                        | $2.5B+        | Planned (Y6+)       |

> **You're investing in Applied Additive.** RapidTools proves the technology in the hardest domain. Same platform enables 3× TAM expansion.

## � The 30-Second Pitch

**Problem:** Factories have $50K-$200K 3D printers gathering dust because design is the bottleneck, not printing. You need a $150K/year CAD engineer to create a $50 fixture.

**Solution:** RapidTools lets production engineers design tooling in hours instead of weeks—just upload a part and answer questions. We handle the CAD.

**Why Now:** $2.14T government investment is building new factories that need 16 million fixtures/year by 2030 (540% growth). There aren't enough tooling engineers on the planet.

**Traction:** Honda invested ₹10 lakh ($12K) in 3D printing hardware and is actively using our software beta. TVS and Toyota in pipeline. Indian Navy exploring indigenization.

**The Ask:** $3M Seed @ $10M pre-money for 30-36 months runway. Path to $104M ARR by Year 8 with $500M-$1B exit.

## 📈 Platform Expansion Optionality

> **For Venture Capitalists:** RapidTools proves our technology in the hardest domain (manufacturing tooling—strictest tolerances, highest liability). The same core technology enables expansion into Medical ($15B), Consumer Products ($6B), and Architecture ($2.5B) markets—**$65B TAM (2025) → $140B+ (2030)**. The Seed round funds RapidTools; the platform architecture enables everything else.

> **Purpose:** Each section is a self-contained, comprehensive document that can later be condensed into the final business plan.

## Key Financial Summary (Year 8)

| Metric         | Value                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Revenue        | $104M ARR                |
| Customers      | 5,500                    |
| Gross Margin   | 59%                      |
| EBITDA         | $18.77M (18%)            |
| Rule of 40     | 53 (35% growth + 18%)    |
| Exit Valuation | $500M–$1B (5-8× ARR)     |
| Total Funding  | $38M ($3M + $10M + $25M) |

**Note:** Gross margin reflects realistic stream-level COGS (Software 20%, Job Work 75%, etc.) with no improvement assumed. Services have structural margin limits but are essential for customer acquisition. Software contributes 82% of gross profit.
