## � Company Structure

| Entity | What It Is | TAM | Status |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Applied Additive** | Platform company—AI-driven intent-to-CAD with computational geometry | $140B+ (2030) | Parent company |
| **RapidTools** | First product vertical—manufacturing tooling (fixtures, jigs, EOAT) | $42B → $65B | **◄ CURRENT FOCUS** |
| Medical | Future vertical—dental, implants, surgical guides | $15B+ | Planned (Y4-Y6) |
| Consumer | Future vertical—jewelry, eyewear, footwear | $6B+ | Planned (Y4-Y6) |
| Architecture | Future vertical—models, restoration, fixtures | $2.5B+ | Planned (Y6+) |

> **You're investing in Applied Additive.** RapidTools proves the technology in the hardest domain. Same platform enables 3× TAM expansion.

## �🎯 The 30-Second Pitch

**Problem:** Factories have $50K-$200K 3D printers gathering dust because design is the bottleneck, not printing. You need a $150K/year CAD engineer to create a $50 fixture.

**Solution:** RapidTools lets production engineers design tooling in hours instead of weeks—just upload a part and answer questions. We handle the CAD.

**Why Now:** $2.14T government investment is building new factories that need 16 million fixtures/year by 2030 (540% growth). There aren't enough tooling engineers on the planet.

**Traction:** Honda paid ₹10 lakh ($12K) for 3D printing hardware and is actively using our software beta. TVS and Toyota in pipeline.

**The Ask:** $3M Seed for 30-36 months runway. Path to $104M ARR by Year 8.

## 📈 Platform Expansion Optionality

> **For Venture Capitalists:** RapidTools proves our technology in the hardest domain (manufacturing tooling—strictest tolerances, highest liability). The same core technology enables expansion into Medical ($15B), Consumer Products ($6B), and Architecture ($2.5B) markets—**$65B TAM (2025) → $140B+ (2030)**. The Seed round funds RapidTools; the platform architecture enables everything else.

> **Purpose:** Each section is a self-contained, comprehensive document that can later be condensed into the final business plan.
