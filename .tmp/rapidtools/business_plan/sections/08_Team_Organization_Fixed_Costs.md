## Executive Summary

**RapidTools' cost structure is designed for capital efficiency** with an India-based team, leveraging Fracktal Works' existing infrastructure. The company targets **$250K-300K revenue per employee by Year 8**, in line with top-quartile SaaS benchmarks for companies at $100M+ ARR [[1]](#ref-1).

### Key Cost Metrics (Year 8 Target)

| Metric               | RapidTools Target | Industry Benchmark     | Source                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Revenue/Employee** | $274K             | $300K (> ARR)          | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **Total Headcount**  | 380               | 350-500 typical        | SaaS Capital [[2]](#ref-2)     |
| **Gross Margin**     | 65%               | 77% median (pure SaaS) | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **S&M as % Revenue** | 30%               | 33% (> ARR)            | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **R&D as % Revenue** | 20%               | 34% median (private)   | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **G&A as % Revenue** | 10%               | 24% median             | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |

**Note:** RapidTools' lower-than-median R&D spend is possible due to India engineering cost advantage (60-70% savings vs. US). Lower G&A reflects India operational leverage.

## Headcount Plan by Year

### Industry Benchmark Context

Per Benchmarkit 2025 SaaS Performance Metrics [[1]](#ref-1):

| ARR Range | Median ARR/FTE | Implied Headcount |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| $20M-     | $175K          | 115-285           |
| $50M-     | $200K          | 250-500           |
| >         | $300K          | 333+              |

**RapidTools Model:** We target $274K ARR/FTE at Year 8, reflecting:

- India cost advantage (allows more headcount per dollar)
- Services component requiring delivery staff
- Still within top-quartile efficiency

### Headcount Summary

| Year   | Revenue | Headcount | Rev/Employee | YoY Growth |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Y1** | $0.5M   | 15        | $33K         | —          |
| **Y2** | $2.5M   | 35        | $71K         | +133%      |
| **Y3** | $7.0M   | 70        | $100K        | +100%      |
| **Y4** | $15.0M  | 120       | $125K        | +71%       |
| **Y5** | $30.0M  | 190       | $158K        | +58%       |
| **Y6** | $50.0M  | 270       | $185K        | +42%       |
| **Y7** | $77.0M  | 340       | $226K        | +26%       |
| **Y8** | $104.0M | 380       | $274K        | +12%       |

**Note:** Y1 Revenue/Employee is low ($33K) because it's an 18-month PMF validation period with limited revenue ($500K from 8 customers). Efficiency improves rapidly as revenue scales faster than headcount, reaching $274K/employee by Y8.

**Customers per Employee:** 5,500 customers ÷ 380 FTEs = **14.5 customers/employee** (healthy for B2B SaaS with services)

## Cost Structure Summary

### Understanding Cost Categories

Per the Revenue Model, RapidTools has **four layers of costs**:

| **Cost Type**           | **Description**                                                               | **Y8 Target**   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **COGS (Variable)**     | Cost of delivering product/service: cloud infra, materials, print labor, etc. | 35% of revenue  |
| **People Cost**         | All FTE salaries + benefits (Engineering, Product, Sales, CS, Ops, Executive) | 20% of revenue  |
| **S&M Variable**        | Marketing programs, trade shows, VAR incentives, sales commissions            | 14% of revenue  |
| **Fixed Costs (G&A)**   | Facilities, tech tools, professional services, compliance, localization       | 4% of revenue   |

**Note:** S&M variable costs are recorded separately from People Cost to properly track go-to-market efficiency.

**VAR Compensation Structure (Tiered):**

- **Base Margin (25-30% tiered, 27% blended):** Deducted BEFORE revenue recognition—customer pays $100, VAR keeps $27 avg, we record $73. NOT a cost line.
- **VAR Incentives ($5.0M/year by Y8):** SPIFs, MDF, volume bonuses paid FROM net revenue. Recorded as S&M Variable expense.

| Tier     | Margin | Requirements                 |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Standard | 25%    | New partners, <$200K annual  |
| Gold     | 28%    | $200K-500K annual, certified |
| Platinum | 30%    | >$500K annual, exclusive     |

### Total Operating Costs by Year

| Year   | Revenue | COGS          | Gross Profit | People Cost | S&M Variable | Fixed Costs | EBITDA   | EBITDA Margin |

| **Y7** | $77.0M  | $27.72M (36%) | $49.28M      | $18.36M     | $9.50M       | $3.50M      | $17.92M  | 23%           |

**Key Observations:**

- **Y1-Y3 are EBITDA-negative/breakeven** (burn period for PMF validation) - expected for early-stage startups
- **COGS % improves** from 46% (Y1) to 35% (Y8) as software mix increases (62% by Y8)
- **Gross margin improves** from 54% (Y1) to 65% (Y8)
- **S&M Variable** scales from 10% (Y1) to 14% (Y8), reflecting proper marketing investment (5% of revenue) and trade show presence (0.8%)
- **Fixed Costs** scale from 32% (Y1) to 4% (Y8) as revenue leverage kicks in
- **EBITDA margin** improves from negative (Y1-Y3) to 27% (Y8)
- **Break-even achieved Y4** - slightly later due to proper marketing/compliance investment, but still capital efficient

## India Cost Advantage Summary

### Cost Comparison: RapidTools vs. US-Based Startup

| Cost Category                  | RapidTools (India) | US Equivalent | Savings         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| **Engineering Team (40 FTEs)** | $2.0M              | $6.4M         | $4.4M (69%)     |
| **Office (8K sq ft, Y4)**      | $96K               | $400K         | $304K (76%)     |
| **Professional Services**      | $156K              | $350K         | $194K (55%)     |
| **TOTAL (sample)**             | **$2.25M**         | **$7.15M**    | **$4.9M (69%)** |

**Implication:** RapidTools can match a $7M US operation for $2.25M, extending runway 3× or enabling faster growth. Post-Series A (Y3 Q2), selective US hires for customer success and sales will shift blended cost upward while maintaining geographic arbitrage on R&D.
