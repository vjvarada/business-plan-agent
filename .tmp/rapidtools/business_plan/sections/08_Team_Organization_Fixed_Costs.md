# Team, Organization & Fixed Costs

> **Last Updated:** January 26, 2026  
> **Status:** Draft

## Executive Summary

**RapidTools' cost structure is designed for capital efficiency** with an India-based team, leveraging Fracktal Works' existing infrastructure. The company targets **$250K-300K revenue per employee by Year 8**, in line with top-quartile SaaS benchmarks for companies at $100M+ ARR [[1]](#ref-1).

### Key Cost Metrics (Year 8 Target)

| Metric               | RapidTools Target | Industry Benchmark     | Source                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Revenue/Employee** | $274K             | $300K (> ARR)          | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **Total Headcount**  | 380               | 350-500 typical        | SaaS Capital [[2]](#ref-2)     |
| **Gross Margin**     | 65%               | 77% median (pure SaaS) | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **S&M as % Revenue** | 24%               | 33% (> ARR)            | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **R&D as % Revenue** | 7%                | 34% median (private)   | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |
| **G&A as % Revenue** | 7%                | 24% median             | Benchmarkit 2025 [[1]](#ref-1) |

**Note:** RapidTools' lower-than-median R&D and G&A spend is possible due to India cost advantage (60-70% savings vs. US). The 7% R&D spend delivers equivalent output to a US company spending 15-18% due to engineering salary differential. S&M at 24% (including CS) reflects channel-led model efficiency.

## Current Team (Pre-Seed / Year 0)

### Founding Team

| Role                 | Name                     | Background                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CEO / Founder**    | Vijay Raghav Varada      | 15 years building Fracktal Works (3D printer OEM); **developed computational geometry engine** (3D printing slicer, mesh algorithms, B-spline operations); built **working demos**—Fixture Automation, Vacuum Casting Tool Automation; deep automotive tooling relationships (Honda, TVS, Toyota) |
| **CTO**              | Hiring (Seed Stage)      | Senior engineering leader to scale the team and accelerate product velocity; target start Q2 2026                                                           |

**Note on Leadership:** Unlike typical solo founders, Vijay combines rare **dual expertise**: (1) deep manufacturing domain knowledge from 15 years building Fracktal Works, AND (2) hands-on computational geometry and software development—having personally built the 3D printing slicer and working demos (Fixture Automation, Vacuum Casting Tool Automation). The CEO can independently execute the core product roadmap. A CTO hire will accelerate development velocity and help scale the engineering team, but is not a blocking dependency for product delivery.

### Active Co-Founder & Advisor Search

RapidTools is actively building out its leadership team:

| Role Sought          | Ideal Profile                                                                                | Status         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Industry Advisor** | Senior automotive manufacturing executive; tooling/die design domain expertise               | In discussions |
| **Technical Mentor** | Deep learning for 3D geometry; experience at Autodesk, Siemens, or similar CAD/CAM companies | In discussions |

**Timeline:** CTO hire targeted for Seed stage (Q2 2026) to accelerate engineering velocity; advisors/mentors expected to formalize Q2-Q3 2026. Note: CEO has been actively building team members with computational geometry expertise over the past few months.

### Fracktal Works Leverage

RapidTools benefits from shared infrastructure with Fracktal Works (founder's existing company):

| Shared Resource            | Annual Savings | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manufacturing Facility** | ~$50K          | 3D printer production for Tooling Services            |
| **Operations Team**        | ~$80K          | Partial allocation of fulfillment staff               |
| **Customer Relationships** | Priceless      | Existing automotive OEM contacts (Honda, TVS, Toyota) |
| **Supply Chain**           | ~$25K          | Established materials sourcing for consumables        |

**Year 1 Burn Reduction:** ~$155K savings from Fracktal leverage

## Headcount Plan by Year

### Industry Benchmark Context

Per Benchmarkit 2025 SaaS Performance Metrics [[1]](#ref-1):

| ARR Range | Median ARR/FTE | Implied Headcount |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| $20M-     | $175K          | 115-285           |
| $50M-     | $200K          | 250-500           |
| >         | $300K          | 333+              |

**RapidTools Model:** We target $274K ARR/FTE at Year 8, reflecting:

- India cost advantage (allows more headcount per dollar)
- Services component requiring delivery staff
- Still within top-quartile efficiency

### Headcount Summary

| Year   | Revenue | Headcount | Rev/Employee | YoY Growth |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **Y1** | $0.5M   | 16        | $31K         | —          |
| **Y2** | $2.5M   | 35        | $71K         | +119%      |
| **Y3** | $7.0M   | 70        | $100K        | +100%      |
| **Y4** | $15.0M  | 120       | $125K        | +71%       |
| **Y5** | $30.0M  | 190       | $158K        | +58%       |
| **Y6** | $50.0M  | 270       | $185K        | +42%       |
| **Y7** | $77.0M  | 340       | $226K        | +26%       |
| **Y8** | $104.0M | 380       | $274K        | +12%       |

**Note:** Y1 Revenue/Employee is low ($31K) because it's an 18-month PMF validation period with limited revenue ($500K from 8 customers). Efficiency improves rapidly as revenue scales faster than headcount, reaching $274K/employee by Y8.

**Customers per Employee:** 5,500 customers ÷ 380 FTEs = **14.5 customers/employee** (healthy for B2B SaaS with services)

### Revenue/Employee Cross-Validation

| Metric | RapidTools Y8 | Industry Benchmark | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Revenue/Employee** | $274K ($104M / 380) | $200-300K for $50M-100M ARR | ✓ Within range |
| **S&M Efficiency** | $912K/S&M FTE ($104M / 114) | $800K-1.2M for vertical SaaS | ✓ On target |
| **Engineering Leverage** | $1.1M/Eng ($104M / 95 Eng) | $800K-1.5M for platform cos | ✓ Strong leverage |
| **CS Ratio** | 72 customers/CS FTE | 50-100 for B2B mid-market | ✓ Healthy ratio |

**Why India Cost Structure Enables This:**
- Avg employee cost: ~$45K/year (vs. $150K+ in US)
- 380 FTEs at India costs = equivalent to ~140 FTEs at US costs
- Effective "US-equivalent" Rev/FTE: $743K — top-decile efficiency

**Services Component Impact:**
- 30% of revenue ($31.6M) is services (Tooling Services + EMS)
- Services requires ~80 delivery FTEs (designers, operators, CS)
- Excluding services staff: 300 FTEs supporting $72.4M software+hardware = $241K/FTE ✓

**Bad Debt Reserve (Prudent Financial Practice):**

- **AR at Y4:** ~$2.0M (45 DSO × $15M ÷ 365)
- **Reserve Rate:** 1.5% (B2B SaaS benchmark: 1-2%)
- **Annual Provision:** $48,000
- **Rationale:** Enterprise customers occasionally face financial distress; SMB churn includes non-payment

| **Stock-Based Compensation**    | $150,000       | 8%         |
| **TOTAL FIXED COSTS**           | **$1,752,000** | **100%**   |

**Fixed Costs as % of Revenue (Y4):** $1.75M ÷ $15.0M = **11.7%**

**R&D-Specific Fixed Costs (Y4):**

| R&D Category              | Annual Cost | Notes                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |

**Note:** R&D Fixed Costs are separate from Engineering People Cost (~$2.0M in Y4). Combined R&D investment = $2.28M = **15% of Y4 revenue**.

**Note on Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):**
- SBC is a **non-cash expense** representing equity grants to employees
- Excluded from EBITDA (industry standard) but included in GAAP operating expenses
- Y4 estimate: $150K (1% of revenue) growing to $2.1M (2% of revenue) by Y8
- ESOP pool: 10-12% reserved for employee grants over 8 years

## Cost Structure Summary

### Understanding Cost Categories

Per the Revenue Model, RapidTools has **five layers of costs**:

| **Cost Type**           | **Description**                                                               | **Y8 Target**   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **COGS (Variable)**     | Cost of delivering product/service: cloud infra, materials, print labor, etc. | 35% of revenue  |
| **People Cost**         | All FTE salaries + benefits (Engineering, Product, Sales, CS, Ops, Executive) | 20% of revenue  |
| **S&M Variable**        | Marketing programs, trade shows, VAR incentives, sales commissions            | 14% of revenue  |
| **Fixed Costs (G&A)**   | Facilities, tools, professional services, compliance, localization, L&D       | 5% of revenue   |
| **Stock Compensation**  | Non-cash equity grants (excluded from EBITDA, included in GAAP OpEx)          | 2% of revenue   |

**Note:** S&M variable costs are recorded separately from People Cost to properly track go-to-market efficiency.

**VAR Compensation Structure (Tiered):**

- **Base Margin (25-30% tiered, 27% blended):** Deducted BEFORE revenue recognition—customer pays $100, VAR keeps $27 avg, we record $73. NOT a cost line.
- **VAR Incentives ($5.0M/year by Y8):** SPIFs, MDF, volume bonuses paid FROM net revenue. Recorded as S&M Variable expense.

| Tier     | Margin | Requirements                 |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Standard | 25%    | New partners, <$200K annual  |
| Gold     | 28%    | $200K-500K annual, certified |
| Platinum | 30%    | >$500K annual, exclusive     |

### Total Operating Costs by Year

| Year   | Revenue | COGS          | Gross Profit | People Cost | S&M Variable | Fixed Costs | SBC (non-cash) | EBITDA   | EBITDA Margin |
| ------ | ------- | ------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| **Y1** | $0.5M   | $0.23M (46%)  | $0.27M       | $0.68M      | $0.05M       | $0.20M      | $0.02M         | ($0.66M) | (132%)        |
| **Y2** | $2.5M   | $1.00M (40%)  | $1.50M       | $1.61M      | $0.25M       | $0.42M      | $0.05M         | ($0.78M) | (31%)         |
| **Y3** | $7.0M   | $2.66M (38%)  | $4.34M       | $3.29M      | $0.70M       | $0.78M      | $0.10M         | ($0.43M) | (6%)          |
| **Y4** | $15.0M  | $5.55M (37%)  | $9.45M       | $5.76M      | $1.50M       | $1.60M      | $0.15M         | $0.59M   | 4%            |
| **Y5** | $30.0M  | $10.80M (36%) | $19.20M      | $9.50M      | $3.00M       | $2.50M      | $0.30M         | $4.20M   | 14%           |
| **Y6** | $50.0M  | $18.00M (36%) | $32.00M      | $14.04M     | $5.50M       | $3.60M      | $0.60M         | $8.86M   | 18%           |
| **Y7** | $77.0M  | $27.72M (36%) | $49.28M      | $18.36M     | $9.50M       | $4.70M      | $1.20M         | $16.72M  | 22%           |
| **Y8** | $104.0M | $36.40M (35%) | $67.60M      | $21.28M     | $14.40M      | $7.10M      | $2.08M         | $24.82M  | 24%           |

**Key Observations:**

- **Y1-Y3 are EBITDA-negative** (burn period for PMF validation) - expected for early-stage startups
- **COGS % improves** from 46% (Y1) to 35% (Y8) as software mix increases (62% by Y8)
- **Gross margin improves** from 54% (Y1) to 65% (Y8)
- **S&M Variable** scales from 10% (Y1) to 14% (Y8), reflecting proper marketing investment (5% of revenue) and trade show presence (0.8%)
- **Fixed Costs** now include explicit R&D infrastructure ($650K Y8), R&D partnerships ($400K Y8), customer enablement, employee L&D, and contingency
- **Stock-Based Compensation** grows from $20K (Y1) to $2.08M (Y8) as equity grants scale with headcount
- **EBITDA margin** improves from negative (Y1-Y3) to 24% (Y8) - excludes SBC per industry standard
- **Break-even achieved Y4** - later due to comprehensive R&D investment, but builds defensible IP moat

**Note on SBC:** Stock-based compensation is shown separately as a non-cash expense. EBITDA excludes SBC (industry standard). If included, GAAP operating margin would be ~22% in Y8.

| R&D Component              | Amount   | % of Revenue | Notes                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Engineering Headcount**  | $5.32M   | 5.1%         | 95 engineers × $56K avg                  |
| **Product Headcount**      | $1.06M   | 1.0%         | 19 product team × $56K avg               |

**Why RapidTools Achieves Industry-Standard Profitability:**

- **S&M at 24%**: Below 33% SaaS median due to VAR channel efficiency (65% of revenue via VARs reduces CAC) and India cost advantage
- **Marketing at 4.8%**: Below 8% SaaS median but appropriate for manufacturing software (5-7% benchmark) with channel-led model
- **R&D at 7%**: Comprehensive investment including CAD licenses ($150K), ML compute ($100K), university research ($75K), and patent portfolio ($75K) — India cost advantage delivers 2-3× output vs. US equivalent
- **G&A at 7%**: Includes R&D infrastructure, customer enablement, employee L&D, and contingency reserves—comprehensive but efficient
- **SBC at 2%**: Conservative vs. 5-15% industry norm; reflects India cost structure and founder-heavy equity
- **EBITDA at 24%**: Meets Rule of 40 (35% growth + 24% margin = 59) while investing comprehensively in R&D and growth

**Note on Rule of 40:** The 24% EBITDA margin reflects comprehensive investments in:
- **R&D Infrastructure** ($650K Y8): CAD/CAM licenses, ML compute, data platforms
- **R&D Partnerships & IP** ($400K Y8): University research, patent portfolio, prototypes
- **Customer enablement/training** ($250K): Reduces churn, improves expansion
- **Employee L&D** ($350K): Reduces attrition, improves productivity  
- **Contingency reserves** ($200K): Prudent risk management
- **Stock-based compensation** ($2.08M): GAAP transparency

| **Office (8K sq ft, Y4)**      | $96K               | $400K         | $304K (76%)     |
| **Professional Services**      | $156K              | $350K         | $194K (55%)     |
| **TOTAL (sample)**             | **$2.25M**         | **$7.15M**    | **$4.9M (69%)** |

**Implication:** RapidTools can match a $7M US operation for $2.25M, extending runway 3× or enabling faster growth. Post-Series A (Y3 Q2), selective US hires for customer success and sales will shift blended cost upward while maintaining geographic arbitrage on R&D.
