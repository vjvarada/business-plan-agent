## THE OPENING (60 seconds)

**"You invested in Fracktal because you saw the opportunity in democratizing 3D printing hardware. I want to show you why the software opportunity is fundamentally larger—and why it actually unlocks the value of every 3D printer Fracktal has ever sold."**

**The Hook:**
- **Fracktal''s market:** Hardware sales (~$500M TAM for industrial 3D printers in India)
- **RapidTools'' market:** $2.1B software/services TAM (tooling design automation)
- **The insight:** Hardware sales are one-time. Software is recurring and enables hardware utilization.

## THE PROBLEM FRACKTAL FACES (2 minutes)

### The $3.6 Billion Paradox

Your research on Fracktal Works revealed this exact problem:

**What Fracktal sells:** Industrial FDM & SLS 3D printers
- Snowflake, Julia, Dragon, Twin Dragon, Apollo SLS
- Customers: TVS Motors, Cisco, metal casting manufacturers

**What their customers struggle with:**
> _"We don''t have the design capability"_ — Common refrain from manufacturers

**The data:**
- 3D printer utilization in Indian manufacturing: **30-40%** (vs 60-70% globally)
- Reason: **Not hardware limitations**—it''s the **design capability gap**
- TVS Motors has Fracktal printers, but still outsources 80% of tooling design

**The bottleneck you invested in hardware to solve is actually a software problem.**
