## Problem

Y1 ending cash of $305K is insufficient runway (less than 6 months of operating expenses).

## Current State

| Metric | Y0 | Y1 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Operating Cash Flow | -$282K | -$39K |
| CapEx | -$75K | -$50K |
| Equity Raised | $750K | $0 |
| Net Cash Flow | $393K | -$89K |
| Ending Cash | $393K | $305K |

## Solution

Increase Seed round from $750K to $1,000K (+$250K).

## Changes to Make

### 1. Assumptions Sheet - Row 10, Column C

| Cell | Old Value | New Value |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| C10 | $750,000 | $1,000,000 |

### 2. Funding Cap Table - Pre-money Valuation (optional adjustment)

Keep pre-money at $2M or adjust to $2.5M to maintain similar dilution.

**Option A (More Dilution):** Keep $2M pre, $1M raise = 33.3% to investors (vs 27.3% currently)
**Option B (Same Dilution):** Raise pre to $2.67M, $1M raise = 27.3% to investors

Recommend: Option A - accept slightly more dilution for runway safety.

## Expected Result

| Metric | Y0 | Y1 |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Equity Raised | $1,000K | $0 |
| Net Cash Flow | $643K | -$89K |
| Ending Cash | $643K | $554K |

Y1 ending cash of $554K provides ~10 months runway.
