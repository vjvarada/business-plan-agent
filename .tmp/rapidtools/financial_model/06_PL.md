## Margin Evolution Story

**Why Blended Margin Stays Flat at ~56-58%:**

1. **Fixed Stream Economics:** Each revenue stream has inherent margin constraints:
   - Software: 80% (pure digital, no COGS)
   - Services: 25-28% (labor + materials cost floor)
   - Hardware: 24% (thin reseller margins)

2. **Mix Shift is Modest:** Software grows from 56% (Y0) to 60% (Y5) of revenue — not enough to dramatically shift blended margin.

3. **Services are Strategic:** Job Work (25% margin) stays at 25% of revenue because it's essential for customer acquisition in Indian SMB market.

**Investor Narrative:**

- "We're a software company that uses services as a customer acquisition channel"
- "Software contributes 82% of gross profit despite being 60% of revenue"
- "Services validate product-market fit and create sticky customer relationships"
- "At scale, we can selectively reduce services exposure or improve utilization"

**Path to Profitability (Revised):**

- **Y0-Y3:** EBITDA-negative as expected for early-stage B2B SaaS
- **Y4:** First EBITDA-positive year ($1.99M, 7% margin) — breakeven achieved
- **Y5:** Profitable growth ($6.0M EBITDA, 12% margin)

## Validation Checks

1. **Revenue Total**: Row 10 = Sum of rows 4-9
2. **COGS by Stream**: Each stream COGS = Revenue × COGS%
3. **Total COGS**: Row 19 = Sum of rows 13-18 = BP target ($220K → $20.86M)
4. **GP by Stream**: Each GP = Revenue - COGS for that stream
5. **Total GP**: Row 35 = Sum of stream GPs = Revenue - Total COGS
6. **Blended Margin**: Row 36 = Total GP / Total Revenue
7. **EBITDA**: Row 46 = Total GP - Total OpEx
8. **Net Income**: Row 60 = PBT - Tax
