# Team, Organization & Fixed Costs

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-17
> **Project:** Constellation Aerospace
> **Status:** Draft (v3 — Y0 budget itemized)

## Executive Summary

Constellation Aerospace operates with **core operations in Bangalore, India**, with founders handling US business development through travel. This India-first approach delivers a **dramatic cost advantage**: a 15-person founding team (10 FTE + 5 interns) costs approximately **₹1.76 Cr ($0.21M) in Y0** — vs $1.34M for an equivalent US-based team. The $1.3M pre-seed is allocated as **$1.0M for satellite payload development** (monolithic Cassegrain telescope + Dhruva 3U bus) and **$0.3M for people + operations**.

The Y0 team is **payload-engineering focused**: 4 of 6 FTE engineers work on the Cassegrain telescope build (Optics, Thermal, CAD, Systems), with AI/ML and platform development running in parallel. The organization grows from **15 people (Y0) to 130+ (Y7)**, with headcount cost scaling from **$0.21M to $3.6M**. Total fixed operating costs (headcount + non-headcount) reach **$6.1M by Y7**, supporting **$30.3M in revenue** and yielding a **revenue-per-employee of ~$233K**.

> **Y0 includes 5 interns** distributed across Satellite/Hardware (2), Software (1), Data Ops (1), and HR/Admin/EA (1). Interns are short-term roles supporting payload development and platform bootstrapping. From Y0→Y1: interns depart (−5) but 12 FTE hires join, netting +7 to reach 22. **HR/Admin/EA** drops from 3→2 (intern leaves; EA + Admin continue as FTEs). **Satellite/Hardware** drops from 6→3 (2 interns leave + CAD Engineer transitions to software after payload CAD work completes); hardware ramps again from Y2 with constellation manufacturing. Software hiring accelerates from Y1 as the platform becomes the growth priority.

> **Y0 fixed costs are deliberately lean ($86K)** because the pre-seed is concentrated on hardware/payload development ($1M). Cloud, travel, insurance, and marketing are kept minimal since Y0 is an R&D/build year. Costs ramp sharply in Y1 as the platform launches, BD travel increases, and ground station operations begin.

### 3.2 US Travel Budget Detail

Founders will handle North American BD through regular travel:

| Purpose                                    | Y0 (Pre-Seed)        | Y1+ (Growth Phase)            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Defense BD meetings (DC, Colorado Springs) | 1–2 trips, $8K       | 6–8 trips/yr, $50K            |
| Industry conferences (GEOINT, SmallSat)    | 1 conference, $5K    | 4–6/yr, $35K                  |
| Customer site visits                       | —                    | 6–10/yr, $40K                 |
| Investor meetings                          | 1 trip, $5K          | 4–6/yr, $25K                  |
| **Total**                                  | **$18K (3–4 trips)** | **$100K–$200K (20–40 trips)** |

> Y0 travel is minimal — founders are heads-down on payload build. BD activity ramps dramatically from Y1 when the platform and first data products are ready for demonstration.

## 4. Total Operating Cost Summary

| Component                   | Y0         | Y1         | Y2         | Y3         | Y5         | Y7         |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Headcount Cost (India)      | $0.21M     | $0.45M     | $0.82M     | $1.28M     | $2.33M     | $3.60M     |
| Fixed Costs                 | $0.09M     | $0.56M     | $1.05M     | $1.46M     | $2.05M     | $2.53M     |
| **Total OpEx (excl. COGS)** | **$0.30M** | **$1.01M** | **$1.87M** | **$2.74M** | **$4.38M** | **$6.13M** |
| Revenue                     | $0.4M      | $1.1M      | $3.0M      | $6.4M      | $16.4M     | $30.3M     |
| **OpEx / Revenue**          | 75%        | 92%        | 62%        | 43%        | 27%        | 20%        |

> Y0 OpEx / Revenue of 75% reflects the lean pre-seed operating structure — most of the $1.3M goes to hardware CapEx, not operating expenses. OpEx is only 20% of revenue by Y7.

### 4.1 Including COGS and CapEx

| Category                          | Y0          | Y1          | Y2          | Y3          | Y5          | Y7          |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OpEx (above)                      | $0.30M      | $1.01M      | $1.87M      | $2.74M      | $4.38M      | $6.13M      |
| COGS (data procurement + sat ops) | $0.22M      | $0.57M      | $1.20M      | $2.24M      | $4.59M      | $8.48M      |

## 5. Efficiency Metrics

### 5.1 Revenue per Employee

| Metric                | Y0   | Y1   | Y3    | Y5    | Y7    | Benchmark            |
| --------------------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -------------------- |
| Revenue / Employee    | $27K | $50K | $114K | $178K | $233K | Planet Labs ~$270K   |
| Cost/Employee (India) | $14K | $20K | $23K  | $25K  | $28K  | US ~$120K            |
| Revenue/Cost Multiple | 1.9  | 2.5  | 5.0   | 7.1   | 8.3   | Exceptional leverage |

**Revenue-per-employee of $233K at Y7** approaches Planet Labs' benchmark, but at **83% lower cost per employee** — this is the India cost arbitrage in action. Y0 cost/employee is especially low ($14K) due to intern-heavy team composition.

### 5.2 Cost Efficiency vs US Competitor

| Y7 Metric        | Constellation (India) | US Competitor (equivalent) | Advantage   |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| 130 employees    | $3.60M headcount      | $20.97M headcount          | 83% savings |
| Fixed costs      | $2.53M                | $6.50M                     | 61% savings |
| Total OpEx       | $6.13M                | $27.47M                    | 78% savings |
| Operating margin | 80%                   | 9%                         | 71pp better |

## 6. Key Insights

- **India-based operations are the structural cost moat** — 84% cheaper than US equivalent at Y0, maintaining 83% advantage at scale
- **Pre-seed of $1.3M is tightly allocated:** $1.0M hardware/CapEx (Cassegrain telescope + Dhruva 3U bus) + $0.21M HR (15-person payload-focused team) + $0.09M operations — zero slack
- **Y0 is an R&D/build year:** 4 of 6 FTE engineers work on the payload; platform generates $0.4M from third-party data resale with just 2 software engineers
- **Cash flow turns positive Y4** — the 3U architecture keeps total CapEx at $19.5M vs ~$41M for 6U–16U, preserving cash throughout
- **130 people by Y7** supports $30.3M revenue at only $6.1M total OpEx (20% of revenue) — SaaS-like operating leverage
- **US travel budget of $18K (Y0) $200K (Y7)** is the primary non-India cost — founders do BD directly until revenue supports a US hire

## 8. Investment Implications

1. **India cost base is a competitive weapon** — Constellation runs a 15-person team for $212K (Y0), scaling to 130 people for $3.6M (Y7), vs $21M for a US competitor
2. **Pre-seed of $1.3M is fully allocated** with zero slack — $1M goes directly into Cassegrain telescope + Dhruva 3U bus, $0.3M covers lean operations for 12 months
3. **Y0 is an R&D year by design** — the team builds the payload and bootstraps the platform; first satellite launch is a Y1 milestone funded by the Seed round
4. **Tightly scoped Y0 reduces pre-seed risk** — Bluehill's $1.3M buys a qualified satellite payload, a working analytics platform, and $0.4M in revenue, all within 12 months
5. **Cash flow positive by ~Y4–Y5** means Series A may be the last equity round needed (Series B optional for acceleration)
6. **Founder-led BD** (US travel budget of $18K Y0) is cost-effective initially but should transition to a US-based hire by Y3–Y4
