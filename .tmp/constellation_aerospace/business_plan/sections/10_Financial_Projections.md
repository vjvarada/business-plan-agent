# Financial Projections

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-17
> **Project:** Constellation Aerospace
> **Status:** Draft (v3 — Y0 budget itemized + 3U CapEx)

## Executive Summary

This section consolidates the 8-year (Y0–Y7 / 2026–2033) financial projections for Constellation Aerospace, synthesizing revenue (Section 07), cost structure (Section 08), and fundraising (Section 09) into a unified P&L, cash flow statement, and balance sheet summary. All projections use USD.

**Headline numbers:** Revenue grows from **$0.4M (Y0) to $30.3M (Y7)**, with EBITDA turning positive in **Y2–Y3** and reaching **$16.2M by Y7 (53% margin)**. Net income turns positive in **Y4 ($1.7M)** after depreciation on cumulative satellite CapEx. Cash flow turns positive on an annual basis in **Y4** (net +$0.17M; Y5 clearly positive at $4.0M net), with cumulative cash remaining **positive throughout** the projection period.

The 3U CubeSat architecture is the key capital efficiency enabler: satellite-specific CapEx of **~$9.6M** (mfg + launch) vs ~$31.6M for a 6U–16U fleet. Y0 is a focused build year — $1.0M goes to the Cassegrain telescope payload + Dhruva 3U bus, with a lean 14-person team (8 FTE + 6 interns) costing only $0.17M. Combined with India-based OpEx of only **$5.6M at Y7** (supporting $30.3M revenue at a 19% OpEx-to-revenue ratio), the company achieves a rare combination: **space-grade capability with software-company capital efficiency**.

> **Tax note:** Accumulated net operating losses (NOL) of $2.69M through Y3 carry forward. Y4 EBIT ($1.71M) is fully offset by NOL (remaining NOL = $0.98M). Y5 taxable income = $4.80M - $0.98M remaining NOL = $3.82M × 25% = $0.96M tax. Y6+ fully taxable.

### 1.2 Profitability Milestones

| Milestone           | Year  | Value  | Significance                      |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| EBITDA Positive     | Y2–Y3 | $0.04M | Marginally positive Y2, solid Y3  |
| EBITDA >30% Margin  | Y4    | 39%    | Platform economics emerging       |
| EBIT Positive       | Y4    | $1.71M | Profitable including depreciation |
| Net Income Positive | Y4    | $1.71M | Fully profitable (NOL offset)     |
| First Tax Payment   | Y5    | $0.96M | NOL partially exhausted           |
| Net Margin >25%     | Y6    | 27%    | Mature profitability              |
| Net Margin >30%     | Y7    | 33%    | Strong software-like margins      |

> **3U impact:** Net income turns positive in **Y4** (vs Y5 in a 6U--16U scenario) because annual D&A is $2.65M (vs $5.56M) --- the 3U architecture reduces the depreciation burden that delays profitability in traditional space companies.

### 2.2 Gross Margin Evolution

**Margin drivers:** Third-party data resale (40% margin) replaced by own-constellation monitoring feeds (80% margin) starting Y2. By Y5, >70% of data revenue is from owned satellites. Platform SaaS maintains 75--85% margin throughout. No own-satellite tasking revenue --- all own-constellation revenue is from archive imagery and monitoring feeds.

| **Total OpEx**        | **0.26** | **0.96** | **2.57** | **4.06** | **5.62** | **100%**       |

> **Y0 OpEx is deliberately lean ($0.26M)** because the $1.3M pre-seed is concentrated on hardware/payload ($1.0M). Cloud, travel, insurance, and marketing are minimal since Y0 is an R&D/build year focused on the Cassegrain telescope and Dhruva 3U bus integration. Note: the pre-seed allocates $0.30M to operations (including ~$40K in one-time setup costs not in the recurring table).

## 4. CapEx Schedule & Depreciation

### 4.1 Capital Expenditure by Category ($M)

| Category                    | Y0       | Y1       | Y2       | Y3       | Y4       | Y5       | Y6       | Y7       | Total     |

| Software/Licenses           | ---      | 0.50     | 0.40     | 0.40     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 3.30      |
| **Total CapEx**             | **1.00** | **1.85** | **3.00** | **3.50** | **3.90** | **2.50** | **2.00** | **1.70** | **19.45** |

> **Y0 CapEx detail ($1.0M):** Satellite Mfg/Bus $0.22M = Dhruva Aerospace 3U OTS bus ($200K) + compute/electronics ($20K). Payload Dev $0.78M = Cassegrain telescope optics & imaging ($500K) + thermal management ($20K) + integration/testing/GSE ($260K). No software CapEx or launch costs in Y0.
>
> **3U cost advantage:** Satellite manufacturing + launch totals $9.77M over 8 years (vs ~$31.6M for a 6U--16U fleet of equivalent size). At $300--600K per satellite (manufacturing + launch combined), Constellation builds a 22-satellite constellation for roughly one-third the satellite cost of a comparable larger-satellite fleet.

### 4.2 Depreciation Schedule ($M)

Satellites and equipment depreciated straight-line over 5 years (LEO satellite design life). D&A by vintage:

| CapEx Vintage | Annual D&A | Y0       | Y1       | Y2       | Y3       | Y4       | Y5       | Y6       | Y7       |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Y0 ($1.00M)   | $0.20M     | 0.20     | 0.20     | 0.20     | 0.20     | 0.20     | ---      | ---      | ---      |
| Y1 ($1.85M)   | $0.37M     |          | 0.37     | 0.37     | 0.37     | 0.37     | 0.37     | ---      | ---      |
| Y2 ($3.00M)   | $0.60M     |          |          | 0.60     | 0.60     | 0.60     | 0.60     | 0.60     | ---      |
| Y3 ($3.50M)   | $0.70M     |          |          |          | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.70     |
| Y4 ($3.90M)   | $0.78M     |          |          |          |          | 0.78     | 0.78     | 0.78     | 0.78     |
| Y5 ($2.50M)   | $0.50M     |          |          |          |          |          | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     |
| Y6 ($2.00M)   | $0.40M     |          |          |          |          |          |          | 0.40     | 0.40     |
| Y7 ($1.70M)   | $0.34M     |          |          |          |          |          |          |          | 0.34     |
| **Total D&A** |            | **0.20** | **0.57** | **1.17** | **1.87** | **2.65** | **2.95** | **2.98** | **2.72** |

> **3U depreciation advantage:** Peak annual D&A is $2.98M (Y6) vs $6.82M in a 6U--16U scenario. This lower depreciation burden is why net income turns positive in Y4 instead of Y5 --- the 3U architecture removes the depreciation overhang that plagues capital-intensive space companies.

### 4.3 Net PP&E ($M)

|                  | Y0       | Y1       | Y2       | Y3       | Y4       | Y5       | Y6       | Y7       |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cumulative CapEx | 1.00     | 2.85     | 5.85     | 9.35     | 13.25    | 15.75    | 17.75    | 19.45    |
| Accumulated D&A  | 0.20     | 0.77     | 1.94     | 3.81     | 6.46     | 9.41     | 12.39    | 15.11    |
| **Net PP&E**     | **0.80** | **2.08** | **3.91** | **5.54** | **6.79** | **6.34** | **5.36** | **4.34** |

> Net PP&E peaks at **$6.79M in Y4** (vs $15.4M in a 6U--16U scenario), then declines as depreciation exceeds new CapEx. The lower asset base reduces balance sheet risk and simplifies asset management.

  Y2: Series A provides $12M buffer -- cash peaks at $9.8M
  Y3-Y4: CapEx draws down cash but it STAYS POSITIVE ($7.7M floor)
  Y4: Cash flow turns positive (net +$0.17M)
  Y5+: Operating CF exceeds CapEx -- cash grows rapidly
  Y7: Company has $29.2M cash -- fully self-funding
```

### 5.3 No Capital Gap --- A Key Advantage of 3U Architecture

**Unlike the 6U--16U scenario (which showed a $7.5M cumulative cash deficit at Y4), the 3U architecture results in cumulative cash remaining positive throughout the entire projection period.** The lowest cash point is $7.7M at Y3 --- a comfortable buffer.

This means:

- **No venture debt required** --- eliminating interest expense and warrant dilution
- **No emergency Series B** --- existing equity fully funds the business to profitability
- **Series A is the last equity round** needed (Series B purely optional for acceleration)
- **Simplified capital structure** --- no debt covenants, no lender negotiations
- **Board dynamics** --- fewer investors, simpler cap table, faster decision-making

**What if revenue disappoints?** Even with 30% lower revenue (Conservative scenario), cumulative cash dips to ~$2M at Y4 but remains positive. Only a >50% revenue miss would create a true capital gap --- an extremely unlikely scenario with the diversified revenue model.

### 8.3 Sensitivity to Key Variables

| Variable           | -20% Impact on Y7 Revenue | Impact on Cash Position                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer Count     | -$6.1M (20%)              | Cash stays positive (floor ~$2M at Y4)             |
| Average ACV        | -$6.1M (20%)              | Cash stays positive (floor ~$2M at Y4)             |
| Churn Rate +5pp    | -$3.0M (10%)              | Minimal impact on cash                             |
| Gross Margin -10pp | -$3.0M EBITDA hit         | Cash stays positive                                |
| CapEx +25%         | No revenue impact         | Increases CapEx by $4.9M; cash floor drops to ~$2M |

> **Key takeaway:** The model is robust. Even under multiple simultaneous adverse scenarios, cumulative cash remains positive --- a direct result of the 3U architecture keeping CapEx manageable.

## 9. Scenario Analysis

### 9.1 Three Scenarios --- Y7 Outcomes

| Metric                     | Conservative | Base Case  | Aggressive             |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Y7 Revenue                 | $18.2M       | $30.3M     | $45.0M                 |

| Implied Valuation (8x Rev) | $146M        | $242M      | $360M                  |

### 9.2 Scenario Assumptions

**Conservative:** 20% fewer clients, 10% lower ACV, 14% churn, own satellites delayed to Y3, CapEx reduced 27%.
**Base Case:** As modeled throughout Sections 02--09.
**Aggressive:** 25% more clients, 15% higher ACV, 8% churn, own satellites operational by mid-Y2, full 30-sat constellation. Requires optional Series B ($10M) for acceleration.

### 9.3 "No Satellites" Scenario

| Metric              | No Satellites | Base Case  |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Y7 Revenue          | $14.0M        | $30.3M     |
| Y7 Gross Margin     | 50%           | 72%        |
| Y7 EBITDA           | $5.5M         | $16.2M     |
| Total CapEx (8yr)   | $4.0M         | ~$19.5M    |
| Total Equity Needed | $4.3M         | $16.3M     |
| Cash at Y7          | $12M          | $29.2M     |
| Implied Valuation   | $70--112M     | $150--360M |

> **The "No Satellites" path is viable but lower-ceiling.** It validates the analytics platform alone at $14M revenue, but the constellation investment is justified by 2x revenue and 22pp margin improvement. With 3U architecture, the incremental investment to build the constellation (~$15.5M more CapEx) generates $16M more Y7 revenue --- a compelling return.

| Investor            | Investment | Ownership¹ | Conservative ($150M) | Base ($240M) | Aggressive ($370M) |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Pre-Seed (Bluehill) | $1.3M      | ~21%       | 24x                  | 39x          | 60x                |
| Seed                | $3M        | ~18%       | 9x                   | 15x          | 23x                |
| Series A            | $12M       | ~24%       | 3.0x                 | 4.8x         | 7.4x               |
| Founders            | —          | ~40%       | $60M                 | $96M         | $148M              |

> ¹ Ownership at time of investment, before subsequent round dilution. Fully diluted returns after all rounds would be ~35–40% lower. MOIC = (Exit Value × Ownership%) ÷ Investment Amount. Section 09 uses the same methodology with different exit assumptions ($150M/$250M/$500M).

## 12. Key Insights

- **Y0 is a focused build year:** $1.0M of the $1.3M pre-seed goes to the Cassegrain telescope + Dhruva 3U bus; EBITDA loss is only $0.08M thanks to the lean $0.26M OpEx
- **EBITDA turns positive Y2–Y3 ($0.04M then $1.6M, 25% margin)** --- the India cost structure enables profitability at just $3–6M revenue
- **Net income positive by Y4** --- 3U architecture reduces annual D&A to ~$2.7M (vs ~$5.6M for 6U--16U), pulling profitability forward by a full year
- **Cumulative cash NEVER goes negative** --- the $16.3M equity raise fully funds ~$19.5M total CapEx plus operating losses, with a $7.7M minimum cash buffer
- **No venture debt, no emergency dilution** --- the 3U architecture eliminates the structural capital gap that plagues most space companies
- **Gross margin expands 45% to 72%** as own-constellation monitoring feeds replace third-party data resale
- **$29.2M cash at Y7** --- the company is not just profitable but accumulating substantial cash reserves
- **Revenue per employee reaches $250K by Y7** --- approaching Planet Labs ($270K) at 85–93% lower per-employee cost
- **8-year cumulative revenue of $90.9M** on $16.3M equity investment demonstrates exceptional capital efficiency (5.6x)

## 13. Investment Implications

1. **3U architecture is a capital efficiency breakthrough**: satellite-specific CapEx ~$9.6M (mfg + launch) vs ~$31.6M for 6U–16U means no capital gap, no debt, and Series A as the last required round
2. **Y0 capital allocation is tight and purposeful:** $1.0M hardware (Cassegrain + Dhruva bus) + $0.17M team + $0.09M operations = $1.3M, zero slack
3. **Unit economics are compelling from Y1:** LTV:CAC >4x and improving, CAC payback <20 months
4. **The margin expansion story is real:** 45% to 72% gross margin as own satellites replace third-party data --- validated by Planet Labs' economics
5. **Cash flow is self-sustaining from Y4** --- net cash flow turns positive in Y4 (+$0.17M); Y5 onward is clearly cash-generative
6. **Multiple exit pathways at $150--370M:** defense prime acquisition, EO major consolidation, or IPO (Planet Labs precedent)
7. **The "No Satellites" fallback validates the platform** at $14M revenue --- investors are not betting on constellation success alone
8. **India cost structure is a durable competitive moat:** 85–93% savings persist as the team scales, creating permanent operating leverage
