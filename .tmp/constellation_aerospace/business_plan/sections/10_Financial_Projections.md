# Financial Projections

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-17
> **Project:** Constellation Aerospace
> **Status:** Draft (v3 — Y0 budget itemized + 3U CapEx)

## Executive Summary

This section consolidates the 8-year (Y0–Y7 / 2026–2033) financial projections for Constellation Aerospace, synthesizing revenue (Section 07), cost structure (Section 08), and fundraising (Section 09) into a unified P&L, cash flow statement, and balance sheet summary. All projections use USD.

**Headline numbers:** Revenue grows from **$0.4M (Y0) to $30.3M (Y7)**, with EBITDA turning positive in **Y3 ($1.4M)** and reaching **$15.7M by Y7 (52% margin)**. Net income turns positive in **Y4 ($1.5M)** after depreciation on ~$19.5M cumulative satellite CapEx. Cash flow turns positive on an annual basis in approximately **Y4–Y5** (Y4 is nearly cash-neutral at −$0.08M net; Y5 is clearly positive at $3.9M net), with cumulative cash remaining **positive throughout** the projection period.

The 3U CubeSat architecture is the key capital efficiency enabler: total constellation CapEx of **~$19.5M** (vs ~$41M for a 6U–16U fleet) means the $16.3M equity raise fully funds operations through profitability. Y0 is a focused build year — $1.0M goes to the Cassegrain telescope payload + Dhruva 3U bus, with a lean 15-person team costing only $0.21M. Combined with India-based OpEx of only **$6.1M at Y7** (supporting $30.3M revenue at a 20% OpEx-to-revenue ratio), the company achieves a rare combination: **space-grade capability with software-company capital efficiency**.

> **Tax note:** Accumulated net operating losses (NOL) of $3.06M through Y3 carry forward. Y4 EBIT ($1.46M) is fully offset by NOL (remaining NOL = $1.60M). Y5 taxable income = $4.48M - $1.60M remaining NOL = $2.88M x 25% = $0.72M tax. Y6+ fully taxable.

### 1.2 Profitability Milestones

| Milestone           | Year | Value  | Significance                      |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| EBITDA Positive     | Y3   | $1.42M | Operating model works             |
| EBITDA >30% Margin  | Y4   | 36%    | Platform economics emerging       |
| EBIT Positive       | Y4   | $1.46M | Profitable including depreciation |
| Net Income Positive | Y4   | $1.46M | Fully profitable (NOL offset)     |
| First Tax Payment   | Y5   | $0.72M | NOL partially exhausted           |
| Net Margin >25%     | Y6   | 26%    | Mature profitability              |
| Net Margin >30%     | Y7   | 32%    | Strong software-like margins      |

> **3U impact:** Net income turns positive in **Y4** (vs Y5 in a 6U--16U scenario) because annual D&A is $2.65M (vs $5.56M) --- the 3U architecture reduces the depreciation burden that delays profitability in traditional space companies.

### 2.2 Gross Margin Evolution

**Margin drivers:** Third-party data resale (40% margin) replaced by own-constellation monitoring feeds (80% margin) starting Y2. By Y5, >70% of data revenue is from owned satellites. Platform SaaS maintains 75--85% margin throughout. No own-satellite tasking revenue --- all own-constellation revenue is from archive imagery and monitoring feeds.

## 4. CapEx Schedule & Depreciation

### 4.1 Capital Expenditure by Category ($M)

| Category                    | Y0       | Y1       | Y2       | Y3       | Y4       | Y5       | Y6       | Y7       | Total     |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |

| Payload Dev & Lab/Equipment | 0.78     | 0.50     | 0.30     | 0.30     | 0.50     | 0.30     | 0.30     | 0.40     | 3.38      |
| Software/Licenses           | ---      | 0.50     | 0.40     | 0.40     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     | 3.30      |
| **Total CapEx**             | **1.00** | **1.85** | **3.00** | **3.50** | **3.90** | **2.50** | **2.00** | **1.70** | **19.45** |

> **Y0 CapEx detail ($1.0M):** Satellite Mfg/Bus $0.22M = Dhruva Aerospace 3U OTS bus ($200K) + compute/electronics ($20K). Payload Dev $0.78M = Cassegrain telescope optics & imaging ($500K) + thermal management ($20K) + integration/testing/GSE ($260K). No software CapEx or launch costs in Y0.
>
> **3U cost advantage:** Satellite manufacturing + launch totals $9.77M over 8 years (vs ~$31.6M for a 6U--16U fleet of equivalent size). At $300--600K per satellite (manufacturing + launch combined), Constellation builds a 22-satellite constellation for less than one-third the cost of a comparable larger-satellite fleet.

### 4.2 Depreciation Schedule ($M)

Satellites and equipment depreciated straight-line over 5 years (LEO satellite design life). D&A by vintage:

| CapEx Vintage | Annual D&A | Y0       | Y1       | Y2       | Y3       | Y4       | Y5       | Y6       | Y7       |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Y0 ($1.00M)   | $0.20M     | 0.20     | 0.20     | 0.20     | 0.20     | 0.20     | ---      | ---      | ---      |
| Y1 ($1.85M)   | $0.37M     |          | 0.37     | 0.37     | 0.37     | 0.37     | 0.37     | ---      | ---      |

| Y3 ($3.50M)   | $0.70M     |          |          |          | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.70     | 0.70     |
| Y4 ($3.90M)   | $0.78M     |          |          |          |          | 0.78     | 0.78     | 0.78     | 0.78     |
| Y5 ($2.50M)   | $0.50M     |          |          |          |          |          | 0.50     | 0.50     | 0.50     |
| Y6 ($2.00M)   | $0.40M     |          |          |          |          |          |          | 0.40     | 0.40     |
| Y7 ($1.70M)   | $0.34M     |          |          |          |          |          |          |          | 0.34     |
| **Total D&A** |            | **0.20** | **0.57** | **1.17** | **1.87** | **2.65** | **2.95** | **2.98** | **2.72** |

> **3U depreciation advantage:** Peak annual D&A is $2.98M (Y6) vs $6.82M in a 6U--16U scenario. This lower depreciation burden is why net income turns positive in Y4 instead of Y5 --- the 3U architecture removes the depreciation overhang that plagues capital-intensive space companies.

### 4.3 Net PP&E ($M)

|                  | Y0       | Y1       | Y2       | Y3       | Y4       | Y5       | Y6       | Y7       |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cumulative CapEx | 1.00     | 2.85     | 5.85     | 9.35     | 13.25    | 15.75    | 17.75    | 19.45    |
| Accumulated D&A  | 0.20     | 0.77     | 1.94     | 3.81     | 6.46     | 9.41     | 12.39    | 15.11    |
| **Net PP&E**     | **0.80** | **2.08** | **3.91** | **5.54** | **6.79** | **6.34** | **5.36** | **4.34** |

> Net PP&E peaks at **$6.79M in Y4** (vs $15.4M in a 6U--16U scenario), then declines as depreciation exceeds new CapEx. The lower asset base reduces balance sheet risk and simplifies asset management.

  Y2: Series A provides $12M buffer -- cash peaks at $9.6M
  Y3-Y4: CapEx draws down cash but it STAYS POSITIVE ($7.3M floor)
  Y5+: Operating CF exceeds CapEx -- cash grows rapidly
  Y7: Company has $27.8M cash -- fully self-funding
```

### 5.3 No Capital Gap --- A Key Advantage of 3U Architecture

**Unlike the 6U--16U scenario (which showed a $7.5M cumulative cash deficit at Y4), the 3U architecture results in cumulative cash remaining positive throughout the entire projection period.** The lowest cash point is $7.3M at Y3--Y4 --- a comfortable buffer.

This means:

- **No venture debt required** --- eliminating interest expense and warrant dilution
- **No emergency Series B** --- existing equity fully funds the business to profitability
- **Series A is the last equity round** needed (Series B purely optional for acceleration)
- **Simplified capital structure** --- no debt covenants, no lender negotiations
- **Board dynamics** --- fewer investors, simpler cap table, faster decision-making

**What if revenue disappoints?** Even with 30% lower revenue (Conservative scenario), cumulative cash dips to ~$2M at Y4 but remains positive. Only a >50% revenue miss would create a true capital gap --- an extremely unlikely scenario with the diversified revenue model.

### 8.3 Sensitivity to Key Variables

| Variable           | -20% Impact on Y7 Revenue | Impact on Cash Position                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer Count     | -$6.1M (20%)              | Cash stays positive (floor ~$2M at Y4)             |
| Average ACV        | -$6.1M (20%)              | Cash stays positive (floor ~$2M at Y4)             |
| Churn Rate +5pp    | -$3.0M (10%)              | Minimal impact on cash                             |
| Gross Margin -10pp | -$3.0M EBITDA hit         | Cash stays positive                                |
| CapEx +25%         | No revenue impact         | Increases CapEx by $4.9M; cash floor drops to ~$2M |

> **Key takeaway:** The model is robust. Even under multiple simultaneous adverse scenarios, cumulative cash remains positive --- a direct result of the 3U architecture keeping CapEx manageable.

## 9. Scenario Analysis

### 9.1 Three Scenarios --- Y7 Outcomes

| Metric                     | Conservative | Base Case      | Aggressive             |

| Implied Valuation (8x Rev) | $146M        | $242M          | $360M                  |

### 9.2 Scenario Assumptions

**Conservative:** 20% fewer clients, 10% lower ACV, 14% churn, own satellites delayed to Y3, CapEx reduced 27%.
**Base Case:** As modeled throughout Sections 02--09.
**Aggressive:** 25% more clients, 15% higher ACV, 8% churn, own satellites operational by mid-Y2, full 30-sat constellation. Requires optional Series B ($10M) for acceleration.

### 9.3 "No Satellites" Scenario

| Metric              | No Satellites | Base Case  |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Y7 Revenue          | $14.0M        | $30.3M     |
| Y7 Gross Margin     | 50%           | 72%        |
| Y7 EBITDA           | $5.5M         | $15.7M     |
| Total CapEx (8yr)   | $4.0M         | $19.5M     |
| Total Equity Needed | $4.3M         | $16.3M     |
| Cash at Y7          | $12M          | $27.8M     |
| Implied Valuation   | $70--112M     | $150--360M |

> **The "No Satellites" path is viable but lower-ceiling.** It validates the analytics platform alone at $14M revenue, but the constellation investment is justified by 2x revenue and 22pp margin improvement. With 3U architecture, the incremental investment to build the constellation (~$15.5M more CapEx) generates $16M more Y7 revenue --- a compelling return.

## 12. Key Insights

- **Y0 is a focused build year:** $1.0M of the $1.3M pre-seed goes to the Cassegrain telescope + Dhruva 3U bus; EBITDA loss is only $0.12M thanks to the lean $0.30M OpEx
- **EBITDA turns positive Y3 ($1.4M, 22% margin)** --- the India cost structure enables profitability at just $6.4M revenue
- **Net income positive by Y4** --- 3U architecture reduces annual D&A to ~$2.7M (vs ~$5.6M for 6U--16U), pulling profitability forward by a full year
- **Cumulative cash NEVER goes negative** --- the $16.3M equity raise fully funds ~$19.5M total CapEx plus operating losses, with a $7.3M minimum cash buffer
- **No venture debt, no emergency dilution** --- the 3U architecture eliminates the structural capital gap that plagues most space companies
- **Gross margin expands 45% to 72%** as own-constellation monitoring feeds replace third-party data resale
- **$27.8M cash at Y7** --- the company is not just profitable but accumulating substantial cash reserves
- **Revenue per employee reaches $233K by Y7** --- approaching Planet Labs ($270K) but at 83% lower per-employee cost
- **8-year cumulative revenue of $90.9M** on $16.3M equity investment demonstrates exceptional capital efficiency (5.6x)

## 13. Investment Implications

1. **3U architecture is a capital efficiency breakthrough**: ~$19.5M total CapEx (vs $41M for 6U--16U) means no capital gap, no debt, and Series A as the last required round
2. **Y0 capital allocation is tight and purposeful:** $1.0M hardware (Cassegrain + Dhruva bus) + $0.21M team + $0.09M operations = $1.3M, zero slack
3. **Unit economics are compelling from Y1:** LTV:CAC >4x and improving, CAC payback <20 months
4. **The margin expansion story is real:** 45% to 72% gross margin as own satellites replace third-party data --- validated by Planet Labs' economics
5. **Cash flow is self-sustaining from ~Y4–Y5** --- operating cash flow exceeds CapEx spending from Y4 onward (Y4 is approximately break-even; Y5 is clearly positive)
6. **Multiple exit pathways at $150--370M:** defense prime acquisition, EO major consolidation, or IPO (Planet Labs precedent)
7. **The "No Satellites" fallback validates the platform** at $14M revenue --- investors are not betting on constellation success alone
8. **India cost structure is a durable competitive moat:** 83% savings persist as the team scales, creating permanent operating leverage
