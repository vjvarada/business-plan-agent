# Go-To-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

Constellation Aerospace employs a **two-geography, vertical-first GTM strategy** targeting North America as the primary market with Indian defense and agriculture as a parallel secondary entry. The sales motion follows the industry-proven **"land with analytics, expand with data"** approach: acquire customers through the analytics SaaS platform using third-party imagery (Phase 1), then deepen relationships and improve margins by integrating own-constellation data (Phase 2+).

The GTM is structured around **three sales motions**: (1) Enterprise direct sales for defense/government and large commercial accounts ($200K+ ACV), (2) mid-market inside sales for agricultural cooperatives and energy operators ($50K–200K ACV), and (3) self-serve platform access for researchers and SMBs (<$50K). Government contracts require long sales cycles (12–18 months) but provide the largest and most predictable revenue — Planet Labs' $734.5M backlog is 80%+ government [[1]](#ref-1).

## 1. Market Entry Strategy

### 1.1 Two-Geography Approach

| Market | Entry Timing | Focus Verticals | Entry Strategy |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **North America** (Primary) | Y0 | Defense, Agriculture, Energy, Insurance | Direct sales + gov contract vehicles |
| **India** (Secondary) | Y1–Y2 | Defense (MoD), Agriculture | Government relationships + local partnerships |

**Why NAM First:**
- Largest single EO market (~40% of global) [[2]](#ref-2)
- Established procurement channels (NGA/CGA, USDA, NOAA)
- Planet Labs' $244M revenue proves market depth in NAM [[1]](#ref-1)
- US defense budget provides predictable, large-contract revenue

**Why India Second (Not Later):**
- India–US iCET framework creates bilateral technology pathway [[3]](#ref-3)
- Indian defense modernization demands commercial EO capabilities
- Agriculture is India's largest sector (150M+ farms) and adoption is accelerating
- Constellation's edge AI reduces bandwidth needs — critical for India's limited ground station infrastructure

### 1.2 Phased GTM Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Revenue Target |
|-------|----------|-------|---------------|
| **Phase 1: Platform Launch** | M1–M6 | Build analytics SaaS; integrate third-party imagery; hire founding sales | $0 (pre-revenue) |
| **Phase 2: Design Partners** | M6–M12 | 5–10 free pilots across defense, agriculture, energy; begin gov credential process | $0.1–$0.2M |
| **Phase 3: Enterprise Sales** | Y1–Y2 | Convert pilots to paid; first gov contract vehicles; enter India market | $1–3M |
| **Phase 4: Constellation Leverage** | Y2–Y4 | Own-satellite data enables unique products; gov IDIQ awards; India defense entry | $3–12M |
| **Phase 5: Scale** | Y4–Y7 | Full constellation operational; multi-geography expansion; platform marketplace | $12–30M |

## 6. India Market Entry Plan

### 6.1 Phased India Approach

| Phase | Timeline | Activity |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Scouting** | Y0–Y1 | Identify India defense procurement channels; engage ISRO partnerships; attend Aero India |
| **Pilot** | Y1–Y2 | 2–3 design partners (defense + agriculture); establish India entity or JV |
| **Operational** | Y2–Y4 | India ground station; defense contract awards; agricultural SaaS launch |
| **Scale** | Y4–Y7 | 10+ India clients; local analytics team; expand to SE Asian markets |

### 6.2 India-Specific Considerations

| Factor | Approach |
|--------|---------|
| **Data Sovereignty** | India ground station for data processing; comply with Remote Sensing Data Policy |
| **Pricing** | India pricing tier (30–50% discount vs NAM) to match local budgets |
| **Partnerships** | Partner with Indian defense contractors (HAL, BEL) for procurement access |
| **Competition** | Limited — Indian EO market less mature than US, few analytics-first players |

## 7. Key Insights

- **Government contracts are the revenue anchor**: Planet Labs' 80%+ government revenue mix validates that defense/intelligence is the largest and most reliable GTM channel in EO [[1]](#ref-1)
- **OTA/SBIR is the fastest government entry**: Defense Innovation Unit and AFWERX specifically seek commercial space + AI solutions — matching Constellation's profile
- **India entry by Y1–Y2** leverages the iCET bilateral framework and creates a second growth vector before the NAM market matures [[3]](#ref-3)
- **Analytics-first GTM reduces friction**: selling insights (subscription) is faster than selling satellite data (procurement-heavy)
- **Partner channels account for 30%+ of revenue by Y7** — defense primes provide access to classified programs that direct sales cannot reach

---

## 8. Investment Implications

1. **Seed funding must support founding sales hire + 5 design partner pilots**: this creates the traction proof needed for Series A
2. **Government credential-building is non-negotiable from M1**: FCC licensing, ITAR, and contract vehicle registration are 6–18 month processes that gate defense revenue
3. **Partner strategy with defense primes accelerates contract wins** by 6–12 months vs direct-only approach
4. **India represents a $350M SAM with lower competition** — entering by Y2 diversifies geographic risk and captures the defense modernization wave
5. **Sales team scales with revenue**: 38-person sales org by Y7 is conservative for $30M ARR; ARR per rep of $500K is above median but achievable for enterprise EO
