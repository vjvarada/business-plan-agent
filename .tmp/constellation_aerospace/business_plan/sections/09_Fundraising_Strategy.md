# Fundraising Strategy

> **Last Updated:** 2026-07-10
> **Project:** Constellation Aerospace
> **Status:** Draft

## Executive Summary

Constellation Aerospace plans to raise **$16–19M in total equity** across three rounds: a **$1.3M Pre-Seed** (secured, term sheet from Bluehill Capital), a **$3M Seed** (Y1), and a **$12–15M Series A** (Y2–Y3). The India-based cost structure means each dollar of funding delivers **4–5 more runway** than a US-headquartered competitor, enabling Constellation to reach operational satellite status and $3M+ ARR before raising Series A.

The total equity raise of $16–19M is purposefully modest for a space company — enabled by Bangalore's cost advantages. Cumulative cash requirement peaks at ~$18–20M by Y4, with **cash flow turning positive by Y5**. A Series B ($25M+) remains an option for acceleration but may not be required if the constellation generates expected data revenue.

- Achieve $1–2M ARR from platform subscriptions + data sales
- Close first government contract (SBIR or OTA)
- Validate on-orbit edge AI processing

> **Note:** 3U production satellites at ~$300–400K each plus ~$100–200K launch means 12 satellites for ~$3.5M — vs ~$5M+ for a 6U–16U fleet of equal size.

**Key Milestones (Series A Profitability or Series B):**

- Operational constellation of 12–16 satellites
- $6–10M ARR with 60%+ gross margin
- Multiple government IDIQ contract vehicles active
- India defense and agriculture revenue stream established

| Metric                  | Constellation (India) | US-Based Competitor | Advantage          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Total Equity Raised     | $16–19M               | $40–60M             | 2.5–3 less capital |
| Months to Break-Even    | ~48 (Y4)              | ~84 (Y7)            | 36 months faster   |
| Revenue at Break-Even   | ~$11M                 | ~$30M               | Lower threshold    |
| Employees at Break-Even | ~75                   | ~120                | 37% fewer          |

## 8. Key Insights

- **$16–19M total equity** is lean for a space company — India cost base enables this, vs $40–60M for a US competitor building equivalent capability
- **Pre-Seed secured** from Bluehill Capital — immediate execution possible with 15-person Bangalore team (10 FTE + 5 interns)
- **Each round achieves clear value inflection**: Pre-Seed MVP/pilots; Seed satellites launched + ARR; Series A operational constellation + $6M+ ARR
- **Cash flow positive by Y5** — Series A may be the final equity round, with Series B optional for acceleration
- **Founder ownership stays ~40% post-Series A** — strong alignment for long-term value creation
- **Strategic exit at $150–500M** delivers 24–79 for pre-seed investors, validated by comparable EO company exits (DigitalGlobe, Planet Labs)

## 9. Investment Implications

1. **Capital efficiency is the story**: India cost base + phased satellite build means $16–19M achieves what $40–60M would in the US
2. **Pre-Seed is secured** — execution risk is the primary variable, not funding risk
3. **Seed is de-risked** by pre-seed milestones (MVP, design partners, satellite design progress)
4. **Series A targets $40–55M pre-money** based on operational satellites + $1–2M ARR + defense contracts
5. **Exit opportunities are diverse**: strategic acquirers (defense primes), IPO pathway (Planet Labs precedent), or growth equity continuation
